/* The main data structure used in the cif module is a description
 * of how to generate CIF layers from the Magic tiles.  There may
 * be several different styles for generating CIF from the same Magic
 * information, e.g. for fabricating at different geometries.  Each
 * of these CIF styles involves three kinds of data.  A "CIFStyle"
 * record gives overall information such as the number of layers.
 * One "CIFLayer" gives overall information for each layer, and
 * then a list of one or more "CIFOp" records describes a sequence
 * of geometrical operations to perform to generate the layer.  This
 * data structure is built up by reading the technology file.
 */

/* A CIFOp starts from a partially-completed CIF layer, does something
 * to it, which may possibly involve some existing layers or temporary
 * layers, and creates the next stage of the partially-completed
 * CIF layer.  Example operations are to AND with some existing paint,
 * or to grow by a certain amount.

/* The opcodes defined so far are:
 *
 * CIFOP_AND -		AND current results with the layers indicated by
 *			the masks.
 * CIFOP_ANDNOT -	Wherever there is material indicated by the masks,
 *			erase those areas from the current results.
 * CIFOP_OR -		OR current results with the layers indicated by
 *			the masks.
 * CIFOP_GROW -		Grow the current results uniformly by co_distance.
 * CIFOP_GROW_G -	Grow the current results to snap to the indicated grid.
 * CIFOP_GROWMIN -	Grow result such that no dimension is less than co_distance.
 * CIFOP_SHRINK -	Shrink the current results uniformly by co_distance.
 * CIFOP_BLOAT -	Find layers in paintMask, then bloat selectively
 *			according to bl_distance, and OR the results into
 *			the current plane
 * CIFOP_SQUARES -	Generates a pattern of squares (used for making
 *			contact vias.  Each square is co_distance large,
 *			the squares are separated from each other by
 *			co_distance, and they are inside the edge of
 *			the material by at least co_distance.
 * CIFOP_SLOTS -	Generate a pattern of rectangles (used for making
 *			slots and slot vias).  Similar to squares except
 *			for different dimensions in short and long tile
 *			dimensions. "0" for the long size indicates that
 *			the slot should extend the length of the tile
 *			minus the long-side border length.
 * CIFOP_BLOATMAX -	Like CIFOP_BLOAT, except whole side of tile gets
 *			bloated by same amount, which is max bloat from
 *			anywhere along side.  Bloats can be negative.
 * CIFOP_BLOATMIN -	Same as CIFOP_BLOAT, except use min bloat from
 *			anywhere along side.
 * CIFOP_BLOATALL -	Added 3/21/05---bloat to encompass all connected
 *			material of the indicated type(s).
 * CIFOP_BBOX -		Added 4/2/05---create a single rectangle encompassing
 *			the cell bounding box.  This involves no magic type
 *			layers but may itself be acted upon with grow/shrink
 *			rules.
 * CIFOP_BOUNDARY -	Added 6/5/19---map the FIXED_BBOX property bounding
 *			box coordinates into CIF layer geometry.
 * CIFOP_NET -		Added 11/3/08---pull an entire electrical net into
 *			the CIF layer, selectively picking layers.
 * CIFOP_MAXRECT -	Reduce all areas to the largest internal fitting
 *			rectangle.
 * CIFOP_COPYUP -	Added 5/5/16---make and keep a copy the resulting layer,
 *			which will be painted into parent cells instead of the
 *			current cell.  This replaces the "fault" method.
 * CIFOP_CLOSE -	Added 11/25/19---close up areas smaller than indicated
 * CIFOP_BRIDGE -	Added 6/11/20---Bridge across catecorner gaps
 * CIFOP_BRIDGELIM -	Added 27/07/20---Bridge across catecorner gaps, but with limiting layers
 * CIFOP_MASKHINTS -	Added 12/14/20---Add geometry from cell properties, if any.
