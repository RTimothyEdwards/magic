This is a mini-scheme interpreter, even though the files are all named
lisp*.{c,h}.

This interpreter is *extremely* slow. I can think of lots of ways to
improve its memory usage and performance (a factor of 5 improvement
seems easy), but it is very robust and it works. :) Besides, it turns
out that the bottleneck in most common tasks is magic itself, not the
interpreter.

The memory usage of this interpreter is ridiculously high. Collect garbage
often. :) Garbage collection is done automatically based on the
variable scm-gc-frequency at the top-level . . . i.e., when you see
magic's ">" prompt. To collect garbage at intermediate points in the
computation, you have to call "collect-garbage" explicitly.
