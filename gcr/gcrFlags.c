/* gcrFlags.c -
 *
 *	Code to set contact and end flags at each grid point in a channel.
 *	This code assumes the channel has already been transformed into left
 *	to right routing form.  These flags are used during channel routing.
 *
 *	Hazard flags are set in the router module, as they are needed by the
 *	global router.  The contact and end flags can not be set at that
 *	time, since we don't yet know in which direction the channel will be
 *	routed.
 *
 *	CONTACT FLAGS mark clear locations bordering single layer obstacles.
 *	Extending a track horizontally across an obstacle requires a track
 *	contact and a layer switch.  Extending a column vertically across an
 *	obstacle requires a column contact and a layer switch.
 *
 *	END FLAGS mark locations beyond which tracks or columns cannot be
 *	extended due to two-layer obstacles.
