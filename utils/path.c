 * PaExpand --
 *	This routine converts tilde notation and environment variable
 *	notation into standard directory names.
 *
 * Results:
 *	If the conversion was done successfully, then the return value
 *	is the number of bytes of space left in the destination area.
 *	If a user name couldn't be found in the password file, then
 *	-1 is returned.
 *
 * Side Effects:
 *	If the first character of the string indicated by psource is a
 *	tilde ("~") then the subsequent user name is converted to a login
 *	directory name and stored in the string indicated by dest.  Then
 *	remaining characters in the file name at psource are copied to
 *	pdest (the file name is terminated by white space, a null character,
 *	or a colon) and psource is updated.  Upon return, psource points
 *	to the terminating character in the source file name, and pdest
 *	points to the null character terminating the expanded name.
 *	If a tilde cannot be converted because the user name cannot
 *	be found, psource is still advanced past the current entry, but
 *	nothing	is stored at the destination.  At most size characters
 *	(including the terminating null character) will be stored at pdest.
 *	Note:  the name "~" with no user name expands to the home directory.
 *
 *	If the first character of the string indicated by psource is a
 *	dollar sign ("$") then the subsequent name is converted to the
 *	expansion of the indicated environment variable.  If the environment
 *	variable does not exist and the indicated name is "CAD_ROOT", then
 *	we substitute the value of CAD_DIR passed down from the Makefile.
 *	Otherwise, we return error status -1.

 *	to look up the file with the original name, doing tilde

 *	is stored in a static string and made available to the caller
 *	through prealName if the open succeeds.  If the entire path is
 *	tried, and still nothing works, then we try each entry in the
 *	library path next.
 *	Note: the static string will be trashed on the next call to this
 *	routine.  Also, note that no individual file name is allowed to
 *	be more than MAXSIZE characters long.  Excess characters are lost.
