 *	FindDisplay --
 *
 * 	This procedure locates information about the color display
 *	to use from a given terminal (determined by tty or the name
 *	of the standard input file) by looking in the file passed.
 *
 * Results:
 *	None.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The parameters pDisplayPort, pTabletPort, pDisType, and
 *	pMonType all point to strings that are modified.  *pDisplayPort
 *	is filled with the name of the port that connects to the graphics
 *	display.  *pTabletPort is filled in with the name of the port to be
 *	used to receive characters from the tablet.  *pDisType is filled
 *	in with the name of the type of display ("OGL", etc.), and
 *	*pMonType is filled in with the name of the monitor type attached
 *	to the display (used to select color maps).
 *
 *	If the file is not found or if there is not a suitable line then
 *	nothing is modified.
 *
 * File format:
 *	Each line in the displays file contains up to five strings
 *	which are, in order, the name of a text terminal, the name
 *	of the corresponding graphics display port, the monitor type
 *	attached to that display, the name of the display type, and
 *	the name of the tablet port to use for that display.  The
 *	tablet port can be omitted, in which case the display port
 *	is used.
