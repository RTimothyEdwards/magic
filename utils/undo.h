 * Procedures for manipulating undo events.

 *	UndoInit	-- start up the undo package and assign a log file.
 *	UndoAddClient	-- used by a client to inform the undo package of
 *			   its existence and to obtain an UndoType used in
 *			   all future interactions with undo.
 *	UndoIsEnabled	-- returns TRUE if the undo package is turned on,
 *			   and FALSE if it is disabled.
 *	UndoNewEvent	-- returns a new UndoEvent which the client may load
 *			   with its own data.  The event is appended to the
 *			   undo log.  The client should not retain this
 *			   new event past the next call to the undo package.
 *			   If undoing is disabled, returns NULL.
 *	UndoNext	-- used by a client to inform the undo package that
 *			   all events since the last call to UndoNext are
 *			   to be treated as a single unit by UndoForward()
 *			   and UndoBackward().
 *	UndoBackward	-- play the undo log backward N units (until the prev-
 *			   ious call to UndoNext()).
 *	UndoForward	-- play the undo log forward N units.
 *	UndoDisable	-- turn off the undo package until the next UndoEnable.
 *	UndoEnable	-- turn the undo package back on.
 *	UndoFlush	-- throw away all undo information.
