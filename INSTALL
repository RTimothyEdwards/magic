Autoconf Capsule Summary:
----------------------------------------

    Compile and install:

	./configure [options]
	make
	make install

    Note: Remember to use 'gmake' on FreeBSD.

    Autoconf options (use "./configure --help" for a complete list):

	--prefix=DIR	Indicates the install directory.  Determines the
			install directory of the executable.  Determines the
			install directory of the libraries (${prefix}/lib)
			unless use of "--libdir=DIR" overrides it.  Defaults
			to /usr/local/.

	--libdir=DIR	By default, ${prefix}/lib/.  Otherwise, run-time
			files used by magic are installed here, and
			${CAD_ROOT} is set to DIR.  In some distributions,
			this is set to /usr/share/.

	--with-interpreter=ARG
			Enable one of the two interpreters.  ARG may be
			one of "tcl" or "scheme".

	--with-tcl	Equivalent to "--with-interpreter=tcl".
			Normally enabled, if available.

	--with-opengl	Enable OpenGL as a graphics option.  Normally
			enabled, if available.

	--without-x	Disable X11 as a graphics option.  Normally
			enabled.

	--disable-nonmanhattan
			Disable non-Manhattan extensions.  Normally
			enabled.

	--disable-readline
			Disable the GNU "readline" package.  Normally
			enabled.
	
	--disable-threads
			Disable threaded X11 and OpenGL graphics.
			Normally enabled.

Notes to Magic maintainers:
--------------------------

This directory contains all the sources for the Magic system and related
programs.  The system runs on a number of machines.  You should read the
Magic Maintainer's manual as well as the introduction to Magic before
compiling the system.  These documents are in the "doc" subdirectory in
PostScript, as well as the original LaTeX source.
    
The "proper" way to profile the amount of CPU time spent in each procedure
is to edit "defs.mak" and add flag "-pg" to CFLAGS.  Then recompile, install,
and run.  Note that this doesn't work with the Tcl version; you have to
compile the standalone version.  After running, magic creates a file "gmon.out".
To view the contents, run "gprof /usr/local/bin/magic > gprof.out" (the output
can be very long). 

Memory tracing in Tcl requires that Tcl and Tk be compiled with the
TCL_MEM_DEBUG option.  Magic also must be compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG,
which can be done by adding the definition -DTCL_MEM_DEBUG to DFLAGS
in defs.mak, after running "configure".

Magic is normally compiled without the optimization flag.  This is handled
by explicitly setting CFLAGS as an environment variable in the top-level
"configure" script prior to calling scripts/configure.  The top-level
configure script needs to be modified to enable compile-time optimization.
