<H2>array</H2>
<HR>
Array everything in the current selection
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>array</B> <I>option</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> is one of the following:
	 <DL>
	   <DT> <I>xsize ysize</I>
	   <DD> Array the selection with <I>xsize</I> copies in the <B>x</B>
		(horizontal) direction and <I>ysize</I> copies in the <B>y</B>
		(vertical) direction.  Array pitch is determined by the
		current cursor box.
	   <DT> <I>xlo xhi ylo yhi</I>
	   <DD> Array the selection with indices <I>xlo, xhi, ylo</I>, and
		<I>yhi</I> inclusive.  Thus, (<I>xhi</I> - <I>xlo</I> + 1)
		copies will be created in the <B>x</B> direction and
		(<I>yhi</I> - <I>ylo</I> + 1) copies will be created in the
		<B>y</B> direction.  Arrayed cell uses will be numbered according
		to the indices.  Array pitch is determined by the current
		cursor box.
	   <DT> <B>count</B> [[<I>xlo</I>] <I>xhi</I> [<I>ylo</I>] <I>yhi</I>]
	   <DD> With no arguments, returns the array indices of the currently
		selected cell.  With arguments, is equivalent to the first two
		options (see above).
	   <DT> <B>width</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> With no arguments, returns the array spacing in <B>x</B> of
		the currently selected cell.  With arguments, redefines the
		spacing in <B>x</B> between cells in the array.
	   <DT> <B>height</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> With no arguments, returns the array spacing in <B>y</B> of
		the currently selected cell.  With arguments, redefines the
		spacing in <B>y</B> between cells in the array.
	   <DT> <B>pitch</B> [<I>x y</I>]
	   <DD> With no arguments, returns the array spacing in <B>x</B> and
		<B>y</B> of the currently selected cell.  With arguments,
		redefines the spacing in <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> between cells
		in the array.
	   <DT> <B>position</B> [<I>x y</I>]
	   <DD> With no arguments, returns the position of the array origin.
		With arguments, redefines the array origin.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>array</B> command creates multiple copies of the current
      paint selection.  In the case of selected paint, only the first
      two options are available, and the function makes multiple copies
      of the selected paint in the <B>x</B> and/or <B>y</B> direction(s).
      In the case of selected cells, the cell is copied multiple times
      but is maintained in the database as an <I>array</I> type, rather
      than multiple individual uses.  As an <I>array</I> type, certain
      functions such as <B>move</B> or <B>copy</B> operate on the array
      as a single unit, and subsequent calles to the <B>array</B>
      command may resize the array. <P>

      The cursor box defines the pitch between cells or paint copies
      in the array.  The height of the box is the pitch in <B>y</B>,
      and the width of the box is the pitch in <B>x</B>. <P>

      The Tcl version allows useful constructs on the command line
      such as:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>array width [expr {1 + [array width]}]</B> <BR>
	<B>move s [array height]</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
      The first example expands the pitch of the array by 1 unit in
      the <B>x</B> direction without requiring explicitly sizing the
      cursor box to match the array pitch.  The second example moves
      the array down by the <B>y</B pitch of the array, for instance,
      to make room for one more cell.  Cells are arrayed to the
      right and above the current selection, so this is the only
      useful way to expand an array to the left or down.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>array</B> is implemented as a <B>magic</B> built-in command.
      Command options which return values from a selected array
      generate Tcl results in the Tcl version of <B>magic</B>.
