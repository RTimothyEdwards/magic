<H3>Usage:</H3>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>suspendall</B> command is a script that invokes the command
      <B>update suspend</B> on all layout windows.  It is used in
      conjunction with the <B>resumeall</B> command and is intended
      for use in Tcl scripts that perform multiple manipulations on
      layout in a window, where it is desired to have the entire
      display refresh at one time at the end of the script rather than
      for each command within the script. <P>

      Because the <B>update</B> command can be nested, calls to
      <B>suspendall</B> and <B>resumeall</B> are likewise nested.
      <B>resumeall</B> does not resume the window refresh until
      it has been called the same number of times as <B>suspendall</B>
      was called.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>suspendall</B> is implemented as a Tcl procedure in the "tools"
      script.
