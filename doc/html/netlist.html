<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>netlist</B> command works with the "netlist tool" and is the
      interface between the layout window and the netlist window as
      generated by the "<B>specialopen netlist</B>" command.  The
      command options, outlined above, allow interactive creation of
      netlists from a layout.  Note that this is only interface code;
      most manipulation of the netlist is handled by the netlist
      window commands (see the section in the
      <A HREF=commands.html>table of contents</A> on the netlist window
      command set).
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>netlist</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
      Prior to magic-7.3 revision 61, these functions were only available
      as built-in button callbacks.  They have been changed to command-line
      commands with the switch to handling buttons like keys, with macro
      bindings.
