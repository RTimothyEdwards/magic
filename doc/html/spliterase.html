<H2>spliterase</H2>
<HR>
Paint into the cursor box, splitting the box diagonally with one layer
forming a right triangle in one corner and space or another layer in
the other.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>spliterase</B> <I>dir layer</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>dir</I> is a valid non-Manhattan direction indicating
         the direction of the right angle corner of the right triangle
         to be erased.  Any paint of layer type <I>layer</I> is erased
	 from this triangular area.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>spliterase</B> command implements a form of non-Manhattan
      geometry that conforms to the corner-stitched tile database
      format used by <B>magic</B> for painting and searching operations
      in a plane.  It lets a rectangular area, as defined by the
      position of the cursor box, be split diagonally, with one half
      containing one layer type, and the other half containing
      another.  While the <B>splitpaint</B> command generates
      non-Manhattan areas by adding paint in a triangular area,
      <B>spliterase</B> creates non-Manhattan areas by subtracting
      paint from a triangular area. <P>

      Note that <B>spliterase</B>, like <B>splitpaint</B>, is somewhat
      cumbersome to use; to generate diagonal wires, use the <B>wire
      segment</B> command instead, which is also able to compute mitred
      joints between segments at different angles. <P>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>spliterase</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
