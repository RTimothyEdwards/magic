<H3>Shortcuts:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Mouse buttons 1 and 3 pressed in the GUI window toolbar implement the
      <B>see</B> and <B>see no</B> commands for the layer represented by
      the toolbar button.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>see</B> [<B>no</B>] <I>layers</I>|<B>allSame</B> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>layers</I> is a comma-separated list of layers
	 in the technology, and may also be the character <B>*</B>
	 indicating all layers but not labels, <B>$</B> indicating
	 all layers under the cursor not including labels and
	 subcells, <B>labels</B> indicating only labels,
	 <B>error</B> indicating DRC error paint, <B>subcell</B>
	 indicating subcells, and <B>connect</B> indicating all
	 types connected to the type or types preceding it.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>see</B> command allows various layers in the layout
      to be made visible, including labels and error paint.
      With the keyword <B>no</B>, the command causes these layers
      to be made invisible on the display. <P>

      The keyword <B>allSame</B> is a special use and indicates that
      non-edit cells should be drawn in the same manner as the edit
      cell, rather than being drawn in the "pale" styles. <P>

      The keyword <B>connect</B> is only meaningful when it comes
      after one or more listed types.  It will expand the list of
      types to include types electrically connected to those types.
      <P>

      The special keyword <B>$</B> is only meaningful when used with
      option "<B>see no</B>", as it refers to all layers visible
      directly under the pointer cursor, and it is not possible to
      query invisible layers. <P>

      Starting with Magic version 7.5, contacts whose residue layers
      (layers surrounding the cut) are partially visible and partially
      invisible will show the visible residue when the contact type
      itself is invisible.  That way, the command "<B>see no * ; see m1</B>",
      for example, will show all metal1 including that under contacts,
      preventing the display of gaps in the metal1 layer where contacts
      are present.  Note that this applies <I>only</I> to contacts, where
      the residue layers are declared in the techfile and therefore
      known <I>a priori</I>.  Other layers, such as metal1 resistor
      (often appears as "rmetal1" in techfiles), have no relation to
      metal1 that can be definitively determined from the techfile.
      Therefore, to see all layers corresponding to a single production
      mask layer, it is necessary to explicitly call out all such layers
      int the <I>layers</I> list. <P>

      Undisplayed layers generally do not respond to commands such
      as <B>erase</B> or <B>select</B>.  However, network selection
      will select across invisible layers, and copying or moving
      such a network selection will alter the invisible layers as
      well as the visible.

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>see</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Bugs:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      It should be enforced everywhere in the code that invisible
      layers cannot be altered.  This may require removing invisible
      layers from a selection after doing a network connectivity
      search.
