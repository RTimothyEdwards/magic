<H2>imacro</H2>
<HR>
Define or print an interactive macro.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>imacro</B> [<I>window_type</I>] <I>key value</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>key</I> is a valid name for a keyboard key and
	 <I>value</I> is the command to be printed to the console,
	 pending completion.  If present, <I>window_type</I> must
	 be one of the window types recognized by the <B>specialopen</B>
	 command:  <B>layout</B>, <B>color</B>, <B>netlist</B>, or
	 <B>wind3d</B>.  If omitted, the <B>layout</B> window type is
	 assumed, unless the command was called from inside a window
	 using the colon or semicolon escape to the command-line, in
	 which case the type of the calling window is assumed.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>imacro</B> command allows a variant of the <B>macro</B>
      command in which the bound command, rather than being immediately
      executed, is instead printed to the console as the beginning
      portion of a command, awaiting completion.  It can be used to
      simplify typing of commands by pre-formatting the command line
      with the command and possibly some options.  For example,
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <B>imacro p "paint "</B>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      will allow the single keystroke "p" to automatically format
      the command "paint " on the command line, waiting for the
      user to enter the type to paint and execute the command. <P>

      Unlike the <B>macro</B> command, commands entered by <B>imacro</B>
      are ultimately evaluated by the Tcl interpreter, and so may
      contain Tcl commands as well as magic commands. <P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>imacro</B> is implemented as a built-in window command in <B>magic</B>.
