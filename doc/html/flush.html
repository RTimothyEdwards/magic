<H2>flush</H2>
<HR>
Forget changes to the edit cell (or to the indicated cell) since the
last saved version.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>flush</B> [<I>cellname</I>] [<B>-noprompt</B>] [<B>-dereference</B>]<BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>cellname</I> is the name of a cell definition to be
	 flushed.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>flush</B> command reverts a cell definition to the last
      version saved to disk, forgetting all changes made in the
      interim.  Without arguments, the current edit cell is flushed.
      Otherwise, the named cell is flushed. <P>

      The effects of the <B>flush</B> command are irrevocable; the
      command cannot be undone with an <B>undo</B> command. <P>

      With the <B>-noprompt</B> option, no interactive confirmation is
      presented if there are unsaved changes.  Those changes will be
      flushed.

      With the <B>-dereference</B> option, any file path that has been
      associated with the cell is discarded, and the cell is reloaded
      from the first location found in the search path.  With search
      path manipulations, this can be used, for example, to switch
      between abstract and full views of a cell.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>flush</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
      However, it conflicts with the Tcl <B>flush</B> command that
      flushes an output pipe.  Special processing determines which use
      is intended.
