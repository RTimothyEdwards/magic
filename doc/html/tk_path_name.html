<HR>
Execute a window command in the indicated window.
<HR>

<H3>Shortcuts:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Key macro <B>:</B> (colon) implements the command <I>tk_path_name</I>
      by prepending the window name to the command typed on the command
      line when the command is executed.  This action is, however,
      transparent to the end user.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <I>tk_path_name command_name</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>command_name</I> is any valid window command
	 for the type of window indicated by <I>tk_path_name</I>.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <I>tk_path_name</I> command is unique for each window
      that is created in magic.  The name of the window is
      registered as a command name with the Tcl interpreter.
      When the window name is used as a command, the arguments
      of the command are passed to the <B>magic</B> command
      interpreter to be executed in the context of that
      specific window.  Effectively, it is the same as typing
      the macro "<B>:</B>" (colon) in a layout window, and then
      typing the command on the command line. <P>

      For example, the default first window that is created in
      the Tcl GUI version of magic is <B>.layout1.magic</B>.
      Upon creation, the command name <B>.layout1.magic</B> is
      registered with the Tcl interpreter.  Subsequently, any
      command on the command-line will be executed in relation
      to that window if it is specified as an option to the
      <B>.layout1.magic</B> command:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         <B>.layout1.magic box 0 0 10 10</B>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      which is exactly the same as putting the X11 pointer
      cursor in the layout window, typing the "<B>:</B>"
      (colon) macro, then typing the command <B>box 0 0 10 10</B>
      into the command line and hitting the <B>return</B> key. <P>

      Similarly to layout windows, windows created with the
      <B>specialopen</B> command have their Tk path names registered
      as commands with the Tcl interpreter, and can be passed
      commands recognized by the specific window type (e.g.,
      netlist commands in the netlist special window).
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <I>tk_path_name</I> is implemented as a built-in command
      in <B>magic</B> which is registered with the Tcl interpreter
      when the window is created and unregistered when the
      window is destroyed.
