<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>ext2spice</B> [<I>option</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> is one of the following:
	 <DL>
	   <DT> [<B>run</B>] [<I>runtime_options</I>]
	   <DD> Run <B>ext2spice</B> on current cell, with command-line options
		(see Summary, below).
	   <DT> <B>default</B>
	   <DD> Reset to default values
	   <DT> <B>format hspice</B>|<B>spice2</B>|<B>spice3</B>
	   <DD> Set output format.  <B>spice3</B> is the default,
		for compatibility with <B>tclspice</B>.  This is a
		change from previous versions of magic, where the
		default was <B>hspice</B>.
	   <DT> <B>rthresh</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> Set resistance threshold value.  Lumped resistances
		below this value will not be written to the output.  The
		value is in ohms, or may be the keyword <B>infinite</B>
		to prohibit writing any lumped resistances to the output.
	   <DT> <B>cthresh</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> Set capacitance threshold value.  The value is in femtofarads,
		or may be the keyword <B>infinite</B> to prohibit writing
		any parasitic capacitances to the output.
	   <DT> <B>merge</B> [<I>merge_option</I>]
	   <DD> Merge parallel devices/transistors.  The valid merge options are:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>conservative</B>
		  <DD> Merge transistors and capacitors having the same device
		       type and node connections and having the same width and
		       length.  Widths are summed in the final output for
		       transistors.  Capacitor values are summed in the final
		       output.
		  <DT><B>aggressive</B>
		  <DD> Merge transistors having the same node
		       connections and having the same length.  Widths
		       are summed in the final output.  Merge any capacitors
		       having the same device type and node connections.
		       Capacitance is summed in the final output.
		  <DT><B>none</B>
		  <DD> Do not merge any devices.
		</DL>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	   <DT> <B>extresist on</B>|<B>off</B>
	   <DD> Incorporate output from the command <B>extresist</B> into
		the final SPICE file.
	   <DT> <B>resistor tee</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> Model resistor capacitance as a T-network.  Each resistor
		device is split into two, with all substrate and overlap
		capacitance placed on the node between the two half-length
		devices.  Without this option, resistor devices lose all
		parasitic capacitance information, and <B>ext2spice</B>
		may produce warnings about unknown nodes.  However, use of
		this option may conflict with LVS (layout-vs.-schematic),
		when only one resistor is expected per drawn device.
	   <DT> <B>subcircuits</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to <B>on</B> (the default), standard cells become
		subcircuit calls ("X") in the SPICE output.  The contents
		of the standard cells are not output, and it is assumed
		that a pre-characterized SPICE deck exists modeling the
		behavior of each standard cell definition.  Standard cells
		are defined by the use of the <B>port</B> method for
		labeling input and output ports.  When set to <B>off</B>,
		ports are ignored, and the entire circuit hierarchy is
		flattened down to the device level.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Without options, or with the option <B>run</B>,
      the <B>ext2spice</B> command converts the hierarchical extracted
      netlist information produced by the <B>extract</B> command in
      a series of <TT>.ext</TT> files into a flattened representation
      in SPICE format, used for detailed analog simulation. <P>

      <I>runtime_options</I> may be passed on the command line, and
      represent the original command-line options passed to the
      standalone version of ext2spice.  A number of the original
      command-line options have been deprecated in the Tcl-based
      version, and some are duplicated by other <B>ext2spice</B> options.
      Valid <I>runtime_options</I> are:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <DL>
	<DT> <B>-B</B>
        <DD> Don't output transistor or node attributes in the SPICE file.
             This option will also disable the output of information such
	     as the area and perimeter of source and drain diffusion and
	     the FET substrate.
	<DT> <B>-F</B>
	<DD> Don't output nodes that aren't connected to devices (floating
	     nodes).
	<DT> <B>-t</B><I>char</I>
	<DD> Trim characters from node names when writing the output file.
             <I>char</I> should be either "<B>#</B>" or "<B>!</B>".  The
	     option may be used twice if both characters require trimming.
	<DT> <B>-y</B> <I>num</I>
	<DD> Select the precision for outputting capacitors. The default is
	     1 which means that the capacitors will be printed to a precision
             of 0.1 fF.
	<DT> <B>-J</B> <B>hier</B>|<B>flat</B>
	<DD> Select the source/drain area and perimeter extraction algorithm.
             If <B>hier</B> is selected then the areas and perimeters are
	     extracted only within each subcell.  For each device in a
	     subcell the area and perimeter of its source and drain within
	     this subcell are output.  If two or more devices share a
	     source/drain node then the total area and perimeter will be
	     output in only one of them and the other will have 0.  If
	     <B>flat</B> is selected the same rules apply, only the scope
	     of search for area and perimeter is the whole netlist.  In
	     general, <B>flat</B> (which is the default) will give accurate
	     results (it will take into account shared sources/drains).
      </DL>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      With options, the command sets various parameters affecting the
      output format and content. <P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>ext2spice</B> is implemented as a separate loadable Tcl package,
      but one which depends on the presence of the standard "tclmagic"
      package.  <B>magic</B> is set up with a placeholder command for
      <B>ext2spice</B>, and will automatically load the Tcl package when
      this command is invoked. <P>

      <B>exttospice</B> is an alias for <B>ext2spice</B>, to satisfy the
      grammatically anal retentive.
