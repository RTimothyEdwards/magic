<H2>addpath</H2>
<HR>
Append to current search path
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>addpath</B> [<I>path</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>path</I> is the path of a directory to add to the
	 list of directories searched for layout cells, relative to
	 the current working directory.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>addpath</B> command is used to control which directories
      magic searches when attempting to read an undefined cell.  It
      can only be used to append new directories to the existing
      search path (see below).  This command is most often used when
      groups of subcells such as a standard-cell library or padframe
      library is kept in a separate place from the rest of the layout.
      In such cases it is convenient to put this command in the
      <B>.magic</B> file in the layout directory to ensure that all
      cells required by the layout are accessible at runtime.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>addpath</B> is a <B>magic</B> built-in command.  It is
      retained for backwards compatibility, but is superceded by
      the <B>path</B> command, which allows complete control over
      the layout search path contents, as well as other search
      paths used by <B>magic</B>.
