<H2>cellsearch</H2>
<HR>
Execute a TCL procedure on each cell definition or instance in the hierarchy
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cellsearch</B> [<B>instances</B>] <I>procedure</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	 where <I>procedure</I> is the name of a predefined Tcl procedure
	 (see Summary, below).
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
     The <B>cellsearch</B> command is a method for user access to
     the <B>magic</B> database search routines.  It searches the
     hierarchical database for all cell definitions and applies
     the callback procedure to each.  If the <B>instances</B>
     keyword is present, it searches the database for all cell
     instances and applies the callback procedure to each.  The
     callback procedure must be defined as described below.
     Note that the callback method into Tcl is inherently slow
     and should only be used for non-compute-intensive tasks. <P>
  
     The Tcl callback procedure for the <B>instances</B> version of
     the <B>cellsearch</B> command is passed six values, the bounding
     box coordinates of the instance, the instance use name (id), and
     the name of the parent cell definition.  The procedure must be
     defined to accept these six arguments, as in the following
     example:
     <BLOCKQUOTE> <TT> <PRE>
	proc inst_callback {llx lly urx ury usename defname} {
	   puts stdout "Instance $usename of $defname bbox $llx $lly $urx $ury"
        }
     </PRE> </TT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

     The Tcl callback procedure for the cell definition search
     is passed one value, the name of the cell definition.  The
     procedure must be defined to accept this single argument, as
     in the following example:
     <BLOCKQUOTE> <TT> <PRE>
	proc def_callback {defname} {
	   puts stdout "Cell $defname"
        }
     </PRE> </TT> </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cellsearch</B> is implemented as an internal <B>magic</B>
      command that links to an external Tcl procedure as a callback
      function.  This routine is experimental and subject to change
      without notice.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Bugs:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      As currently implemented, there is no protection against
      calling a <B>magic</B> command from the callback procedure
      that will alter the internal cell hash table while it is
      being traversed, causing a crash.  The implementation
      should be changed to a 2-step procedure that traverses the
      cell hash table first, creating an internal list of function
      arguments to pass for each cell, and then executes the
      callback function on each. <P>

      There are more efficient ways of executing the callback
      function than Tcl_EvalEx().  In particular, the procedure
      should be cast as a Tcl object and Tcl_EvalObjEx() used.<P>

      The callback function should allow in-line Tcl procedures
      and use the standard Tcl/Tk method of "%" escape sequences
      used as arguments to the callback function that allow the
      user to specify what arguments are passed to the callback
      function (as is done for the <B>tag</B> command).
