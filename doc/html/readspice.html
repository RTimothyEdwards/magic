<H2>readspice</H2>
<HR>
Read a SPICE netlist file and use the information from subcircuit definitions in the file to set port indexes.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>readspice</B> <I>filename</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>filename</I> is the path name of a SPICE netlist file containing one or more subcircuit definitions.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>readspice</B> command is used to ensure that port indexes on
      port labels in a cell match the port order specified in an existing
      SPICE netlist for that cell.  This is generally used with standard
      cell libraries to ensure that port order is maintained in cells that
      are read from GDS or LEF, neither of which declares a port order.
      It will also create ports from labels in the case where a file read
      from GDS does not contain layers that are interpreted as ports by
      the technology file's <B>cifinput</B> section.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>readspice</B> is implemented as a Tcl procedure defined
      in the GUI wrapper script.  It is only available when the wrapper
      is used, that is, when <B>magic</B> is invoked with argument <B>-w</B>,
      although the script can be sourced from the runtime library.
