Circuit netlist extractor

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>extract</B> <I>option</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> may be one of the following:
	 <DL>
	   <DT> <B>all</B>
	   <DD> Extract the root cell and all its children.  This bypasses
		the incremental extraction and ensures that a new <TT>.ext</TT>
		file is written for every cell definition.
	   <DT> <B>cell</B> <I>name</I>
	   <DD> Extract the currently selected cell into file <I>name</I>
	   <DT> <B>do</B>|<B>no</B> [<I>option</I>]
	   <DD> Enable or disable an extractor option, where <I>option</I>
		may be one of the following:
	      <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT> <B>capacitance</B>
		  <DD> Extract local parasitic capacitance values to substrate
		  <DT> <B>resistance</B>
		  <DD> Extract lumped resistance values.  Note that this
			is <I>not</I> the same as full parasitic resistance.
			The values extracted are "lumped" resistance and
			indicate the value for which the delay through the
			net can be computed with R times C, where R is the
			lumped resistance and C is the parasitic capacitance.
			This is a very coarse approximation, as it assumes
			equal delay from the driver to any receiver.  For
			full R-C extraction, see the <B>extresist</B>
			command.  Lumped resistances have no meaning in
			SPICE netlists and will only be used when running
			<B>ext2sim</B> to generate a .sim netlist.
		  <DT> <B>coupling</B>
		  <DD> Extract the parasitic coupling capacitance between
			nodes.
		  <DT> <B>length</B>
		  <DD> Extract the length of the shortest path from a driver
			to a receiver, for computing more accurate parasitic
			resistances.
		  <DT> <B>adjust</B>
		  <DD> Adjust all capacitances for overlap between a parent
			cell and child instance, or between instances in an
			array.  Parasitic capacitance is removed to account
			for the amount of overlap.  Note that this method
			can produce negative capacitors in the parent.  When
			the netlist is flattened for simulation, the total
			of all capacitances in parent and child, or between
			array instances, is guaranteed to be strictly positive.
		  <DT> <B>all</B>
		  <DD> Apply all standard options (does not include options
			"local", "labelcheck", or "aliases").
		  <DT> <B>local</B>
		  <DD> Write all .ext files to the current working directory.
			If not specified, each .ext file will be placed in the
			same directory as the .mag file from which it is
			derived, unless the .mag file is in a directory which
			is not writable.  In that case, the .ext file will also
			be written to the current working directory.
		  <DT> <B>labelcheck</B>
		  <DD> Check for labels which have zero area and connect
			to a subcell on the edge;  this case is rare but is
			computationally expensive to check for, so the feature
			is disabled by default.
		  <DT> <B>aliases</B>
		  <DD> By default (starting with version 8.3.217), magic only
			extracts a single name for a net, unless the net connects
			to a port, in which case the port name is extracted as
			well.  With the <B>aliases</B> option enabled, all names
			for a net are extracted;  this can be useful for debugging
			but will usually just slow down processing by commands
			like "ext2spice" that use the .ext file contents, so it
			is disabled by default.
		</DL>
	      </BLOCKQUOTE>
		These options (except for "local") determine how much
		information is written to the output file.  By default,
		all options are selected.  Normally, the options in
		<B>ext2spice</B> or <B>ext2sim</B> are used to select
		which information from the .ext file is used in the
		resulting netlist.  There is no need to restrict the
		information being extracted.  All options add relatively
		little overhead to the extraction time.  The output file
		size can be reduced by not generating some extraction
		information.

	   <DT> <B>length</B> [<I>option</I>]
	   <DD> Control pathlength extraction information, where <I>option</I>
		may be one of the following:

		<DL>
	          <DT> <B>driver</B> <I>termname</I>

	   <DT> <B>help</B>
	   <DD> Print help information
	   <DT> <B>parents</B>
	   <DD> Extract the selected cell and all its parents
	   <DT> <B>showparents</B>
	   <DD> List the cell and all parents of selected cell.  Note that
		this is not really an extract option and is superceded by
		the <B>cellname</B> command.
	   <DT> [<B>list</B>|<B>listall</B>] <B>style</B> [<I>stylename</I>]
	   <DD> Set the current extraction style to <I>stylename</I>.
		Without arguments, print the current extraction style.
		With keyword <B>list</B>, return the current extraction
		style as a Tcl result.  With keyword <B>listall</B>, return
		all valid extraction styles for the technology as a Tcl
		list.
	   <DT> <B>unique</B> [<I>#</I>]
	   <DD> Generate unique names when different nodes have the same name.
		When option "<I>#</I>" is present, only make unique names for
		labels tagged by ending with the "<B>#</B>" character. <BR>
		<I>Warning:</I>  This operation immediately modifies the
		existing layout in preparation for extraction.  Label
		modifications are permanent, and cannot be undone.  All
		cells in the hierarchy may potentially be modified. <BR>
	   <DT> <B>unique</B> [<I>option</I>]
	   <DD> (From Magic 8.1.24) With no option, generate unique names
		when different nodes have the same name.  <I>option</I> may
		be one of the following:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		  <DL>
		    <DT> <B>all</B>
		    <DD> Equivalent to no option;  all labels with the same
			 name on different nets are given unique names.
		    <DT> <B>#</B>
		    <DD> Labels that are tagged by ending with the character
			 "<B>#</B>" are made unique for each instance on an
			 electrically unique node.
		    <DT> <B>noports</B>
		    <DD> Labels that are not ports are made unique when on
			 different nets.  Ports, however, are ignored.  This
			 option is useful for standard cells which may be
			 hiding internal connectivity.
		    <DT> <B>notopports</B>
		    <DD> This option behaves like <B>extract unique noports</B>
			 on the topmost cell in the hierarchy, and otherwise
			 behaves like <B>extract unique all</B> on all cells
			 below the top (available from magic 8.3.205).

		<I>Warning:</I>  This operation immediately modifies the

	   <DT> <B>warn</B> [[<B>no</B>] <I>option</I>]

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
        With no options given, the <B>extract</B> command incrementally
	extracts the root cell and all its children into separate
	<TT>.ext</TT> files.  With options, the effect is as described
	in the Usage section above.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>extract</B> is implemented as a built-in <B>magic</B> command. <P>
      <B>ext</B> is an alias for command <B>extract</B> (allowed
      abbreviation where the usage would otherwise be ambiguous).
