<H2>refresh</H2>
<HR>
Refresh the 3D display
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>refresh</B> 
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>refresh</B> command clears and redraws the 3D window
      display.  The 3D display does not maintain areas requiring
      updates like the layout window (this is very difficult to
      do in 3 dimensions), so updating the view to reflect changes
      made to the layout often requires a manual refresh.
      However, all commands that change any aspect of the 3D
      display will also cause a refresh.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>refresh</B> is implemented as a built-in <B>wind3d</B>
	window command in <B>magic</B>.  It can only be invoked from
	a window created with the <B>specialopen wind3d</B> command,
	or the <B>render</B> procedure.  Note that the <B>wind3d</B>
	window is only available when magic is compiled with the OpenGL
	graphics option and invoked with <B>magic -d OGL</B>. <P>
	
      Note that macros of the <B>wind3d</B> window are hard-coded,
	and cannot be changed with the <B>macro</B>, <B>gmacro</B>, or
	<B>imacro</B> commands.  There is no "<TT>:</TT>" macro for
	entering commands; to enter commands from the command-line,
	use the <A HREF=../tk_path_name.html> <I>tk_path_name</I></A>
	command.  The default Tk path name of the <B>wind3d</B> window
	is "<TT>.magic3d</TT>".
