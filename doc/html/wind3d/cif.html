<H3>Shortcuts:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Key macro <B>C</B> implements the command <B>cif</B>.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cif</B> <BR><BR>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>cif</B> command toggles between the view of the layout
      as CIF (equivalently, GDS) layers, and the magic database
      layers.  The view of CIF/GDS layers is default, because the
      representation of contacts is much clearer in the CIF/GDS
      view. <P>

      To view CIF/GDS layers in the 3D rendering window, it is
      necessary to have rendering information in the technology
      file for each CIF/GDS layer, presented in the <B>cifoutput</B>
      section with the <B>render</B> keyword.  This information
      includes the style with which to render the layer, and
      height and thickness information for each layer.  Note that
      this height and thickness is currently used only for rendering
      purposes, and so values are effectively arbitrary.  Height
      and thickness values corresponding to the <B>magic</B>
      database layers can be provided in the <B>extract</B> section
      of the technology file, and is used for three-dimensional
      geometry extraction as well as the 3D window viewing of the
      <B>magic</B> database layers.

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cif</B> is implemented as a built-in <B>wind3d</B>
	window command in <B>magic</B>.  It can only be invoked from
	a window created with the <B>specialopen wind3d</B> command,
	or the <B>render</B> procedure.  Note that the <B>wind3d</B>
	window is only available when magic is compiled with the OpenGL
	graphics option and invoked with <B>magic -d OGL</B>. <P>
	
        Note that macros of the <B>wind3d</B> window are hard-coded,
	and cannot be changed with the <B>macro</B>, <B>gmacro</B>, or
	<B>imacro</B> commands.  There is no "<TT>:</TT>" macro for
	entering commands; to enter commands from the command-line,
	use the <A HREF=../tk_path_name.html> <I>tk_path_name</I></A>
	command.  The default Tk path name of the <B>wind3d</B> window
	is "<TT>.magic3d</TT>".
