   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Key macro <B>/</B> (slash) implements the command <B>what</B>.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>what</B> [<B>-list</B>[<B>all</B>]] <BR><BR>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>what</B> command queries what material is in the current
      selection.  This includes a report on layers, labels, and subcell
      instances that are selected. <P>

      In the Tcl version of <B>magic</B>, the <B>-list</B> option
      returns the result as a Tcl list containing three sub-lists.
      The first sub-list contains the types found, the second contains
      the labels found, and the third contains the subcells found.
      Each label in the second sub-list is itself a list of three
      items:  The label text, the layer the label is attached to, and
      the cell def containing the label.  Each subcell in the third
      sub-list is itself a list of two items:  The subcell instance
      ID name, and the cell definition name. <P>

      <B>-listall</B> is a variant of the Tcl list, in which the first
      sub-list contains the types found, where each entry is itself a
      list.  Each list entry first item is the name of the layer, and
      the second entry is a list containing the names of all subcells
      where that type is found. <P>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>what</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
