<H2>units</H2>
<HR>
Cause distance measurements to be interpreted by default (with no
suffix provied) as measurments of the selected units, and also cause
distance measurements to be printed in the selected units.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>units</B> command causes printed measurements to be
      given in the selected units.  The possible unit types are
      <B>internal</B>, the size of the internal database units,
      <B>lambda</B>, the lambda grid based on the technology minimum
      feature size, <B>user</B> (or <B>grid</B>), based on the
      value given by the user to the <B>grid</B> command, or
      <B>microns</B>, which are physical units dependent on the
      CIF or GDS output scaling as defined in the technology file. <P>

      The <B>units</B> command also changes the way
      that <A HREF=distance.html>distance measurements</A> are
      interpreted in commands that take distance arguments, such
      as <B>move</B>, <B>copy</B>, and <B>stretch</B>.  An integer
      number with no other identifying units is interpreted as a
      measurement in the current units type.  All other measurements
      must have an identifying unit: <B>i</B> for internal units,
      <B>l</B> for lambda units, and <B>g</B> for user grid units,
      as well as the usual metric units such as <B>um</B> for
      microns, <B>nm</B> for nanometers, and so forth.  See the
      reference page on <A HREF=distance.html>distance measures</A>
      for a complete description of distance values. <P>

      For printed units, the additional argument <B>print</B>
      causes the units to be printed along with the value;  e.g.,
      "<B>1.0um</B>."  This is the usual setting for interactive
      use.  The argument <B>noprint</B> suppresses the unit name,
      which is appropriate for scripted use, when the value may
      be passed to arithmetic expressions to be evaluated by the
      interpreter. <P>

      <B>units</B> with no arguments returns the current units type.
      <B>units list</B> returns the current units type as a Tcl list
      of two items;  the first item is the units type, and the second
      item is <B>print</B> or <B>noprint</B>, indicating whether units
      suffixes are printed with the values. <P>

      Historically, values parsed from the command line were interpreted
      according to the <B>snap</B> setting.  On startup, this behavior
      remains in effect for backwards compatibility until overridden
      with a <B>units</B> command.  The command <B>units default</B>
      reverts back to the original behavior.  Once the <B>units</B>
      default type is overridden, the <B>snap</B> behavior is controlled
      independently of <B>units</B>. <P>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>units</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
