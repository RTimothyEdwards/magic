<H2>setlabel</H2>
<HR>
Manipulate rendered font labels
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>setlabel</B> [<B>-default</B>] <I>option</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> is one of the following:
	 <DL>
	   <DT> <B>text</B> [<I>string</I>]
	   <DD> Report the text string of all selected labels, or change
		the text string of selected labels to <I>string</I>.
	   <DT> <B>font</B> [<I>name</I> [<I>scale</I>]]
	   <DD> Report the font of all selected labels, or set the font
		to the font named <I>name</I>, where <I>name</I> is one
		of the known fonts returned by the command "<B>setlabel
		fontlist</B>".  If the named font is not in the list, magic
		will attempt to load it, if the font vector list can be
		found (the font vector list should be in an unencoded
		PostScript Type3 font format).  Magic scales all fonts
		such that label size can be specified in database units.
		Unfortunately, fonts tend to have characters (accents, for
		example) well above the height of a standard capital letter,
		and these characters result in the inability to extract the
		font height from the font metrics.  In such (common) cases,
		the optional floating-point <I>scale</I> value specifies the
		difference between the character height and the font height
		reported by the font metrics.  Typically, this number is
		around 0.6.
	   <DT> <B>font</B> <I>number</I>
	   <DD> For <I>number</I> zero or larger, this option returns the
		name of the font that is index <I>number</I> into the list
		of loaded fonts.  No other action is taken.  For <I>number</I>
		equal to <B>-1</B>, the font of the selected label is reset
		to the default X11 font, and properties such as scale,
		offset, and rotation are ignored.  Justification is retained.
	   <DT> <B>fontlist</B>
	   <DD>	Return a list of the known, loaded fonts.
	   <DT> <B>justify</B> [<I>position</I>]
	   <DD> Report the justification of all selected labels, or change the
		justification to <I>position</I>, which may be any compass
		direction or "center".
	   <DT> <B>size</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> Report the size of all selected labels, or change the size of
		selected labels to <I>value</I>, which may be given in units
		of lambda, or a metric measurement (e.g., "<B>1um</B>").  The
		text will be adjusted so that the height of capitalized text
		from the text baseline is equal to the requested value.
	   <DT> <B>offset</B> [<I>x y</I>]
	   <DD> Report the offset of all selected labels (in <I>x y</I> pairs),
		or change the offset, which is the spacing between the point
		marked by the label and the label text.  In the case of a
		rectangle identifying a label, the spacing is measured from the
		center of the rectangle.
	   <DT> <B>rotate</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> Report the angle of rotation of all selected labels, or change
		the angle, which is measured in degrees counterclockwise.
		Any integer angle is acceptable.  Labels are always drawn
		upright, so labels rotated from 90 to 270 degrees undergo an
		additional 180 degree rotation <I>within their bounding box</I>
		to ensure that the text always remains upright.  Likewise,
		rotations and reflections of subcells are applied to the
		label bounding box, with the text rotated within the bounding
		box to ensure an upright orientation.  If this explanation is
		a bit obscure, then the rule is:  if a label is drawn on a cell
		such that it occupies a specific place with respect to the cell
		layout, then it will always appear in that same place regardless
		of how the cell is oriented in the hierarchy of a layout.
	   <DT> <B>layer</B> [<I>name</I>]
	   <DD> Report the layer type to which the label is attached.
		If the optional <I>name</I> is given, and is a valid layer
		name, then the label is modified to be attached to that
		layer type.  Note that if the layer is not also declared
		"sticky" (see below), then it is likely to be reattached to
		the original layer during certain operations.
	   <DT> <B>sticky</B> [<B>true</B>|<B>false</B>]
	   <DD> Report the status of the "sticky" flag for the label.  Labels
		which have the "sticky" flag set can only attach to the
		assigned layer type.  Such labels may be placed over a layer
		that exists only in a subcell, unlike non-sticky labels,
		which will reattach to any available layer or else be
		assigned to "space".  Value returned is 1 (true) or 0 (false).
		If "<B>true</B>" or "<B>false</B>" is specified, then the
		sticky flag is set or cleared, respectively.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>setlabel</B> command manipulates selected text labels.  In versions
	of <B>magic</B> prior to 8.0, labels could not be manipulated, but could
	only be changed by removing and replacing the label.  Labels were drawn
	in an X11 font that was scaled relative to the window, not the layout.
	<B>setlabel</B> not only allows text strings to be modified on any labels,
	but also allows labels to be drawn in scaled fonts, rotated and offset
	to a specific position.  Fonts are read from simple, ASCII-encoded
	PostScript Type-3 font files, such as provided by the Freefont project.
	<BR><BR>

	If <B>-default</B> is specified, then the given option is set as a
	default, if a value is supplied.  If no value is supplied, then the
	value of the default is returned.  The default values are applied
	when the "<B>label</B> command is issued without the full set of
	values.  The <B>-default</B> option may be used with any label
	property except for <I>text</I>.
	<BR><BR>

	The default values, if not changed by using the <B>-default</B> option,
	are as follows:
	<DL>
	    <DT> <B>font</B>
	    <DD> <B>default</B> Fixed-width X11 bitmap font.
	    <DT> <B>justify</B>
	    <DD> <B>-1</B>  Default justification, automatically determined.
	    <DT> <B>size</B>
	    <DD> <B>0</B>  Size is determined by the default font.
	    <DT> <B>offset</B>
	    <DD> <B>0 0</B>  Text is not offset.
	    <DT> <B>rotate</B>
	    <DD> <B>0</B>  Text is not rotated.
	    <DT> <B>layer</B>
	    <DD> <B>-1</B>  Default layer type, automatically determined.
	    <DT> <B>sticky</B>
	    <DD> <B>0</B>  Labels are not sticky by default.
	</DL>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>setlabel</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>
	version 8.0 (or higher) only.
