<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>ext2spice</B> [<I>option</I>] [<I>cellname</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> is one of the following:
	 <DL>
	   <DT> [<B>run</B>] [<I>runtime_options</I>]
	   <DD> Run <B>ext2spice</B> on current cell, with command-line options
		(see Summary, below).
	   <DT> <B>default</B>
	   <DD> Reset to default values
	   <DT> <B>format hspice</B>|<B>spice2</B>|<B>spice3</B>|<B>ngspice</B>
	   <DD> Set output format.  <B>spice3</B> is the default,
		for compatibility with <B>tclspice</B>.  This is a
		change from previous versions of magic, where the
		default was <B>hspice</B>.
	   <DT> <B>rthresh</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> Set resistance threshold value.  Lumped resistances
		below this value will not be written to the output.  The
		value is in ohms, or may be the keyword <B>infinite</B>
		to prohibit writing any lumped resistances to the output.
	   <DT> <B>cthresh</B> [<I>value</I>]
	   <DD> Set capacitance threshold value.  The value is in femtofarads,
		or may be the keyword <B>infinite</B> to prohibit writing
		any parasitic capacitances to the output.
	   <DT> <B>merge</B> [<I>merge_option</I>]
	   <DD> Merge parallel devices/transistors.  The valid merge options are:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>conservative</B>
		  <DD> Merge transistors and capacitors having the same device
		       type and node connections and having the same width and
		       length.  Device multipliers ("M=") are output for each
		       set of merged devices.
		  <DT><B>aggressive</B>
		  <DD> Merge transistors having the same node
		       connections and having the same length.  Widths
		       are summed in the final output.  Merge any capacitors
		       having the same device type and node connections.
		       Capacitance is summed in the final output.
		  <DT><B>none</B>
		  <DD> Do not merge any devices.
		</DL>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	   <DT> <B>extresist on</B>|<B>off</B>
	   <DD> Incorporate output from the command <B>extresist</B> into
		the final SPICE file.
	   <DT> <B>resistor tee</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> Model resistor capacitance as a T-network.  Each resistor
		device is split into two, with all substrate and overlap
		capacitance placed on the node between the two half-length
		devices.  Without this option, resistor devices lose all
		parasitic capacitance information, and <B>ext2spice</B>
		may produce warnings about unknown nodes.  However, use of
		this option may conflict with LVS (layout-vs.-schematic),
		when only one resistor is expected per drawn device.
	   <DT> <B>subcircuit</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to <B>on</B> (the default), and if the cell selected
		for SPICE output has defined ports on the top level, then
		the cell becomes a subcircuit definition in the output, and
		the output has no top-level calls to any devices.  This
		format is appropriate for including in a testbench netlist,
		for example.  If the top-level cell does not have defined
		ports, then there is no way for magic to determine what
		the ports might be, or what order they may be in, making
		it impossible to generate a consistent subcircuit, so in
		the absence of ports, this option has no function.
		Ports are defined by the use of the <B>port</B> method for
		labeling input and output ports.  When option
		<B>subcircuit</B> is set to <B>off</B>, the top-level
		circuit will be the top level of the netlist, and it
		will have no associated subcircuit definition.
	   <DT> <B>subcircuit top</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> This variant of the <B>subcircuit</B> option controls
		whether or not ext2spice generates a .subckt wrapper
		around the top-level circuit.  If the top-level circuit
		does not have defined ports, then no .subckt wrapper
		will ever be generated, because ext2spice will not
		be able to know which nets are the ports.
	   <DT> <B>subcircuit descend</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to <B>off</B>, the <B>subcircuit descend</B>
		option will not descend into any subcells below the
		top level, writing only the top-level circuit to the
		output.  The default is <B>on</B>.  This option can be
		useful for writing out digital circuits made from
		standard cells, since the digital subcircuits can usually
		be included from a vendor library.
	   <DT> <B>scale</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to <B>on</B>, the scale value is set by the
		SPICE "<B><TT>.scale</TT></B>" card, recognized by some
		SPICE parsers.  All device lengths, widths, and areas
		are then given in integer units (internal database
		units).  When set to <B>off</B>, all device widths,
		lengths, and areas are given in unscaled, physical
		dimensions.
	   <DT> <B>short</B> [<B>voltage</B>|<B>resistor</B>|<B>none</B>]
	   <DD> Determines behavior with respect to ports with different
		names connected to the same net.  SPICE does not have a
		universal method for describing a net with more than one
		name.  A common way of handling this is by separating
	        differently-named parts of a net with a zero-ohm ideal
		resistor or a zero-volt DC source.  "<B>ext2spice short</B>"
		uses one of these methods to preserve duplicate port names.
		"<B>ext2spice short resistor</B>" uses the zero-ohm resistor
		method, which "<B>ext2spice short voltage</B>" uses the
		zero-volt source method.  "<B>ext2spice short none</B>"
		reverts to the default behavior, which is to remove all
		port names except for one from the netlist.
	   <DT> <B>hierarchy</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to <B>on</B>, magic will extract a hierarchical
		representation of the circuit, in which the cell hierarchy
		of the layout is represented in SPICE by
		"<B><TT>.subckt</TT></B>" macros.  "ext2spice hierarchy"
		does not require that subcircuits have port labels.  Each
		subcircuit will be analyzed for port connections, and port
		connections will be consistent in the SPICE output between
		the subcircuit definition (".subckt") and instantiated
		calls ("X") to that subcircuit.
	   <DT> <B>blackbox</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to "on", views marked as abstract will be output
		as subcircuit calls ("X") but there will be no associated
		subcircuit definition output.  A circuit is considered
		"abstract" if at the time of extraction it has a property
		named "LEFview".  A cell will automatically be given this
		property if it is read from a LEF input file.  It may also
		be given this property using the "<B>property</B>" command.
		In order for the blackbox view to be meaningful, the
		subcell must declare ports (see the "port" command).
	   <DT> <B>renumber</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to <B>on</B>, subcircuit calls (see above;  only
		used for certain options such as "subcircuit", "hierarchy",
		or with extracted device types "subcircuit" or "rsubcircuit")
		are numbered sequentially "X1", "X2", etc., as encountered
		by the extractor.  When set to <B>off</B>, subcircuit
		calls (when used with options "subcircuit" or "hierarchy",
		but not applying to low-level extracted subcircuit devices)
		will be rendered in the SPICE output file as "X" followed
		by the ID (name) of the cell instance.
	   <DT> <B>global</B> [<B>on</B>|<B>off</B>]
	   <DD> When set to <B>on</B> or default, unconnected global nets
		of the same name in subcells are merged in the output.  When
	        set to <B>off</B>, such nets are left unconnected.
	   <DT> <I>cellname</I>
	   <DD> Name of the cell to generate output for.  This item is optional;
		if not specified, then ext2spice generates output for the
		current edit cell.
	   <DT> <B>lvs</B>
	   <DD> Apply settings appropriate for running LVS (layout vs. schematic).
		These settings are as follows:
		<UL>
		   <LI> hierarchy on
		   <LI> format ngspice
		   <LI> cthresh infinite
		   <LI> rthresh infinite
		   <LI> renumber off
		   <LI> scale off
		   <LI> blackbox on
		   <LI> subcircuit top auto
		   <LI> global off
		</UL>
		This command applies the settings but does not generate output
		(<I>i.e.</I>, does not run <B>ext2spice</B>), so that settings
		can be overridden if necessary. <BR>
		(The <B>lvs</B> option was introduced in version 8.2.79).

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Without options, or with the option <B>run</B>,
      the <B>ext2spice</B> command converts the hierarchical extracted
      netlist information produced by the <B>extract</B> command in
      a series of <TT>.ext</TT> files into a flattened representation
      in SPICE format, used for detailed analog simulation. <P>

      <I>runtime_options</I> may be passed on the command line, and
      represent the original command-line options passed to the
      standalone version of ext2spice.  A number of the original
      command-line options have been deprecated in the Tcl-based
      version, and some are duplicated by other <B>ext2spice</B> options.
      Valid <I>runtime_options</I> are:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <DL>
	<DT> <B>-M</B>
	<DD> Aggressive merging of devices.  If the lengths of FET
	     devices connected in parallel are equal, then add their
	     widths together to form a single device.  Overrides any
	     value specified by the "ext2spice merge" command option.
	<DT> <B>-m</B>
	<DD> Conservative merging of devices.  If the lengths and
	     widths of FET devices connected in parallel are equal,
	     then add their widths together to form a single device.
	     Overrides any value specified by the "ext2spice merge"
	     command option.
	<DT> <B>-o</B> <I>filename</I>
	<DD> Save the output as file <I>filename</I> (<I>filename</I>
	     must include any file extension, as there is no standard
	     extension for SPICE files).
	<DT> <B>-j</B> <I>device</I><B>:</B><I>class</I>
			[<B>/</B><I>subclass</I>] <B>/</B><I>subsnode</I>
	<DD> Override values of resistance class, substrate resistance
	     class, and substrate node name for device type <I>device</I>.
	     Resistance classes are indexed by number and must match the
	     definition in the technology file's extract section.
	<DT> <B>-f spice2</B>|<B>spice3</B>|<B>hspice</B>|<B>ngspice</B>
	<DD> Choose the output SPICE format for compatibility with
	     different versions of SPICE.
	<DT> <B>-d</B>
	<DD> Distribute junction areas and perimeters.  The Magic extractor
	     computes area and perimter values per <I>node</I>, not per
	     <I>device</I>.  For devices that share a node, Magic cannot
	     distinguish between the devices (for parasitic calculations, 
	     it's not necessary to distinguish between the devices).
	     Normally, when generating device output, Magic writes the
	     lumped area and perimeter values along with the first device
	     attached to a node, and sets the area and perimeter values
	     for all remaining devices on that node to zero.  The <B>-d</B>
	     option causes Magic to distribute the node area and perimeter
	     evenly among all devices attached to that node.
	<DT> <B>-B</B>
        <DD> Don't output transistor or node attributes in the SPICE file.
             This option will also disable the output of information such
	     as the area and perimeter of source and drain diffusion and
	     the FET substrate.
	<DT> <B>-F</B>
	<DD> Don't output nodes that aren't connected to devices (floating
	     nodes).
	<DT> <B>-t</B><I>char</I>
	<DD> Trim characters from node names when writing the output file.
             <I>char</I> should be either "<B>#</B>" or "<B>!</B>".  The
	     option may be used twice if both characters require trimming.
	<DT> <B>-y</B> <I>num</I>
	<DD> Select the precision for outputting capacitors. The default is
	     1 which means that the capacitors will be printed to a precision
             of 0.1 fF.
	<DT> <B>-J</B> <B>hier</B>|<B>flat</B>
	<DD> Select the source/drain area and perimeter extraction algorithm.
             If <B>hier</B> is selected then the areas and perimeters are
	     extracted only within each subcell.  For each device in a
	     subcell the area and perimeter of its source and drain within
	     this subcell are output.  If two or more devices share a
	     source/drain node then the total area and perimeter will be
	     output in only one of them and the other will have 0.  If
	     <B>flat</B> is selected the same rules apply, only the scope
	     of search for area and perimeter is the whole netlist.  In
	     general, <B>flat</B> (which is the default) will give accurate
	     results (it will take into account shared sources/drains).

      With options, the command sets various parameters affecting the
      output format and content. <P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>ext2spice</B> is implemented as a separate loadable Tcl package,
      but one which depends on the presence of the standard "tclmagic"
      package.  <B>magic</B> is set up with a placeholder command for
      <B>ext2spice</B>, and will automatically load the Tcl package when
      this command is invoked. <P>

      <B>exttospice</B> is an alias for <B>ext2spice</B>, to satisfy the
      grammatically anal retentive.

      <B>ext2spice</B> is also implemented as a script to be run from
      the shell command line, where it executes magic in batch mode
      (i.e., using the <B>-dnull</B> option) and runs the ext2spice
      command automatically.  With this usage, the syntax is:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	   <B>ext2spice</B> [ <I>magic_options</I> <B>--</B> ]
		<I>ext2spice_runtime_options ext_file</I>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      The double-dash separates command options passed to magic on
      startup (such as "<B>-T</B> <I>technology</I>" to specify the
      technology) from those runtime options (see above) passed to
      the <B>ext2spice</B> command.
