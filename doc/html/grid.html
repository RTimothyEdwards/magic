      <B>grid</B> [<I>option</I>]<BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	 where <I>option</I> may be one of the following:

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>grid</B> command has two purposes:  to draw a reference grid
      on the screen as an aid to layout placement, and to define a snap
      grid of arbitrary (and not necessarily square) units.  This second
      use works in conjunction with the <B>snap</B> command; with the
      invocation of <B>snap grid</B> (or, equivalently, <B>snap user</B>),
      standard magic dimensions for commands such as <B>move</B>, <B>copy</B>,
      <B>box</B>, <B>stretch</B>, and mouse-button movement of the cursor
      box are parsed as integer divisions of the user grid.  The grid does
      not have to be visible ("<B>grid on</B>") for the snap function to be
      enabled. <P>

      Note that the grid has both spacing values and an offset;  unlike the
      lambda grid, which is always aligned to the internal coordinate system,
      the user grid may be any value; for grid spacings that are not a
      multiple of internal or lambda values, the grid may need to be
      offset from the origin to get the desired alignment.  To do this,
      specify the <I>x_origin</I> and <I>y_origin</I> values, which
      describe the offset of the grid origin from the internal coordinate
      system origin. <P>

      Usually there is no reason to have different <I>x_spacing</I> and
      <I>y_spacing</I> values (only one spacing value is required for
      both).  However, occasionally it may be useful to define something
      like the following:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>grid 150um 3l; snap grid</B>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      This example makes it easy to draw a number of horizontal routing
      lines aligned to a pad cell spacing of 150 microns. <P>

      Note that even when the grid is set to visible, at a large enough
      zoom factor, where the grid lines become dense, the grid will not
      be drawn. <P>

      <B>grid</B> with no arguments toggles the visibility of the grid
      lines on the screen.

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>grid</B> is implemented as a built-in window command in <B>magic</B>.
