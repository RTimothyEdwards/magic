<H2>search</H2>
<HR>
Execute a TCL procedure on each tile in the current edit cell definition.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>search</B> [<I>layers</I>] <I>procedure</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	 where <I>layers</I> is a comma-separated list of layer types
	 to generate a mask to limit the tile search, and <I>procedure</I>
	 is the name of a predefined Tcl procedure (see Summary, below).
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
     The <B>search</B> command is a method for user access to
     the <B>magic</B> database search routines.  It searches the
     tile database of the current edit cell definition and its
     hierarchy of descendents and applies the callback procedure
     to each.  The callback procedure must be defined as described
     below. <P>

     Note that the callback method into Tcl is inherently slow
     and should only be used for non-compute-intensive tasks.
     In particular, unless it is known that the cell definition
     being traversed has relatively few structures, the <I>layers</I>
     argument should be used to severely limit the scope of the
     search.  This function can be useful in certain situations,
     such as parsing a layout for layer "pad" to enumerate the number
     of pads in a design. <P>
  
     The Tcl callback procedure is passed five values, the four
     coordinates of the tile, and the layer type of the tile.
     The procedure must be defined to accept these five arguments,
     as in the following example:
     <BLOCKQUOTE> <TT> <PRE>
	proc tile_callback {llx lly urx ury ttype} {
	   puts stdout "Tile type $ttype at $llx $lly $urx $ury"
        }
     </PRE> </TT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

     When non-manhattan tiles are parsed, the type $ttype is passed
     as a list of two string elements, the type on the left side of
     the diagonal split, and the type on the right side of the
     diagonal split.

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>search</B> is implemented as an internal <B>magic</B>
      command that links to an external Tcl procedure as a callback
      function.  This routine is experimental and subject to change
      without notice.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Bugs:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      As currently implemented, there is no protection against
      calling a <B>magic</B> command from the callback procedure
      that will alter the internal tile structures while the tile
      plane is being traversed, causing a crash.  The implementation
      should be changed to a 2-step procedure that traverses the
      tile plane first, creating an internal list of function
      arguments to pass for each tile, and then executes the
      callback function on each. <P>

      There are more efficient ways of executing the callback
      function than Tcl_EvalEx().  In particular, the procedure
      should be cast as a Tcl object and Tcl_EvalObjEx() used.<P>

      The callback function should allow in-line Tcl procedures
      and use the standard Tcl/Tk method of "%" escape sequences
      used as arguments to the callback function that allow the
      user to specify what arguments are passed to the callback
      function (as is done for the <B>tag</B> command).
