<H2>cif</H2>
<HR>
Read CIF input or generate CIF output.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cif</B> [<I>option</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> is one of the following:
	 <DL>
	    <DT> <B>help</B>
	    <DD> Print usage information
	    <DT> <B>arealabels</B> [<B>yes</B>|<B>no</B>]
	    <DD> Enable/disable use of the CIF area label extension.  The
		 default is "yes".  Normally there is no reason not to
		 do this.
	    <DT> [<B>list</B>] <B>coverage</B> <I>layer</I> [<B>box</B>]
	    <DD> Report the coverage of the indicated CIF layer within the
		 bounds of the current edit cell.  This is useful for
		 fabrication processes that require a minimum amount of
		 coverage for specific layers (usually the metal routing
		 layers).  With option <B>list</B> in front, return only
		 the coverage value, as a decimal.  Otherwise, the value
		 is returned as a percentage, with additional diagnostic
		 information about the area analyzed. <P>
		 With option "<B>box</B>", report the density inside the
		 cursor box area only.
	    <DT> <B>idcell</B> [<B>yes</B>|<B>no</B>]
	    <DD> Enable/disable use of the CIF cell ID extension.  The
		 default is "yes".  Normally there is no reason not to
		 do this.
	    <DT> <B>scale</B> <B>in</B>|<B>out</B>
	    <DD> Report the number of microns per internal unit for
		 the current style.  If "<B>in</B>" is specified,
		 the value is reported for the current CIF/GDS input
		 style.  If "<B>out</B>" is specified, the value is
		 reported for the current CIF/GDS output style.  <P>
		 <I>Warning:</I> For a long time (prior to magic 8.0.180),
		 this function was
		 "<B>cif lambda in</B>|<B>out</B>" and claimed to
		 return the number of microns per lambda.  For
		 backwards compatibility, this syntax is retained,
		 but its use is discouraged.
	    <DT> <B>limit</B> [<I>value</I>]
	    <DD> Limit the amount of internal grid subdivision to the
		 indicated value (which is dimensionless, the ratio
	         of the maximum subdivision to the current lambda
		 value).  If no <I>value</I> is given, the current
		 limit is reported.  By default, the value is set to
		 100, as grid subdivision smaller than this amount
		 can result in integer overflow on subsequent CIF or
		 GDS output.
	    <DT> <B>rescale</B> [<B>yes</B>|<B>no</B>]
	    <DD> Allow or disallow internal grid subdivision while reading
		 CIF input.  Default is "yes".  Normally, one wants to allow
	 	 rescaling to ensure that the CIF is displayed exactly as it
		 is in the input file.  Occasionally, however, the CIF input
		 is on a very fine scale, such as nanometers, and it is
		 preferable to snap the input to lambda boundaries rather
		 than to subsplit the internal grid to such a fine value.
		 The <B>limit</B> option may also be used to limit grid
		 subdivision to a minimum value (see above).
	    <DT> <B>drccheck</B> [<B>yes</B>|<B>no</B>]
	    <DD> (Introduced in Magic version 8.0.176)  Set to "yes" by
		 default, causing all cells in the input file to be
		 marked as not checked by DRC as they are input.  Set this
		 to "no" to force magic to treat the CIF cells as "known
		 DRC clean".
	    <DT> <B>warning</B> [<I>option</I>]
	    <DD> Set warning information level.  "<I>option</I>" may be one
		 of the following:
		 <DL>
		 <DT><B>default</B>
		 <DD> The default setting is equivalent to all the other
		      options (<B>align</B>, <B>limit</B>, <B>redirect</B>,
		      and <B>none</B>) being disabled.
		 <DT><B>align</B>
		 <DD> Generate warnings during a "<B>cif see</B>" command
		      if the alignment of geometry is on fractional lambda.
		      Normally, magic allows contacts to be drawn at
		      half-lambda positions.  If this violates DRC requirements
		      for the minimum output grid, this warning setting can be
		      used to detect such violations.
		 <DT><B>limit</B>
		 <DD> Limit warnings to the first 100 warnings or errors only. 
		 <DT><B>redirect</B> [<I>file</I>]
		 <DD> Redirect all warnings to an output file named <I>file</I>.
		      If <I>file</I> is not given, then redirection is disabled.
		 <DT><B>none</B>
		 <DD> Do not produce any warning messages on CIF input.
		 </DL>
	    <DT> <B>polygon subcells</B> [<B>yes</B>|<B>no</B>]
	    <DD> Put non-Manhattan polygons into subcells.  Default is "no".
		 Normally this option is not needed.  However, input layout
		 that defines a number of angled wires, particularly those
		 that are closely spaced, can cause <B>magic</B> to generate
		 literally millions of internal tiles.  This tends to be
		 true in particular for corner cells in padframes for deep
		 submicron feature sizes, where the angled corners are
		 required to meet the DRC specification.  When set to "yes",
		 each polygon encountered in the CIF input is placed in its
		 own uniquely-named subcell.  This prevents interations with
		 other polygons on the same plane and so reduces tile splitting.
	    <DT> <B>paint</B> <I>cif_layers</I> <I>magic_layer</I> [<I>cellname</I>]
	    <DD> Generate the CIF layer(s) specified by <I>cif_layers</I>,
		 then import them into the Magic database as layer
		 <I>magic_layer</I>.  If <I>cellname</I> is specified, then
		 the paint is generated in that cell (which will be created,
		 if it does not already exist).  Otherwise, paint is generated
		 directly in the edit cell.  This is a very useful function,
		 as it allows the automatic generation of layout from boolean
		 operations.  Principal uses are to auto-generate fill
		 patterns, auto-generate obstruction geometry in a standard
		 cell, to automatically place substrate and well contacts
		 into a standard-cell array, and so forth.
	    <DT> <B>see</B> <I>layers</I>
	    <DD> View the CIF/GDS output layers in the comma-separated list
		 <I>layers</I> as feedback entries on the layout.  This is
		 useful for determining what the actual foundry layer types
		 are doing as a result of the boolean operations in the
		 CIF/GDS output style.  Most useful for debugging technology
		 file CIF/GDS output style sections, or tracing DRC error
		 reports from sources other than <B>magic</B>.  CIF output
		 is computed and feedback is shown only inside the cursor
		 box area.

		 <IMG SRC=graphics/cif_see.gif> <BR>
		 <I>Figure 1.  Command <B>cif see CSP</B> shows the P+
		 implant layer surrounding the P diffusion regions within
		 the cursor box area.</I>
		 </CENTER>
	    <DT> <B>statistics</B>
	    <DD> Print statistics from the CIF generator, including tile
		 operations, rectangles output, and interactions between
		 cells.  Not especially useful to the typical end-user.
	    <DT> <B>prefix</B> [<I>path</I>]
	    <DD> Prepend the path name <I>path</I> to cell names in the
		 CIF output.  If no <I>path</I> is specified, reports the
		 existing path name.
	    <DT> [<B>list|listall</B>] <B>istyle</B> [<I>style</I>]
	    <DD> Set the current input style to <I>style</I>.  If no
		 <I>style</I> is specified, returns the current input
		 style.  To get a list of all available input styles
		 in the current technology, use the <B>listall
		 istyle</B> option.  The <B>list istyle</B> option
		 returns the current style name as a Tcl result.
	    <DT> [<B>list|listall</B>] <B>ostyle</B> [<I>style</I>]
	    <DD> Set the current output style to <I>style</I>.  If no
		 <I>style</I> is specified, returns the current output
		 style.  To get a list of all available output styles
		 in the current technology, use the <B>listall
		 ostyle</B> option.  The <B>list ostyle</B> option
		 returns the current style name as a Tcl result.
	    <DT> <B>flat</B> <I>file</I>
	    <DD> Output CIF format to "<I>file</I>" for the window's root
		 cell, flattening the hierarchy prior to output.
	    <DT> <B>read</B> <I>file</I>
	    <DD> Read CIF format from file <I>file</I> into the edit cell.
		 If <I>file</I> does not have a file extension, then <B>magic</B>
		 searches for a file named <I>file</I> or <I>file</I>.cif.
	    <DT> <B>write</B> <I>file</I>
	    <DD> Output CIF format to "<I>file</I>" for the window's root cell.
	 </DL>

	 <BR>
         "Wizard" options:  Where <I>option</I> is one of the following:
	 <BR>
	 <DL>
	    <DT> <B>*hier</B> <I>layer</I>
	    <DD> This option is like "<B>cif see</B>" but shows the layers
		 that are generated as the result of hierarchical interactions
		 between subcells (not including interactions between components
		 of a subcell array;  see below).
	    <DT> <B>*array</B> <I>layer</I>
	    <DD> This option is like "<B>cif see</B>" but shows the layers
		 that are generated as the result of hierarchical interactions
		 between components of subcell arrays.
	    <DT> <B>*hier write</B> [ <B>enable</B> | <B>disable</B> ]
	    <DD> This sets a global option that enables (default) or disables
		 the generation of output CIF or GDS layers due to interaction
		 between subcells (not including inter-array interactions;
		 see below).  For large standard cell layouts where the
		 standard cells are known to abut properly without causing
		 spacing or overlap errors, disabling hierarchical generation
		 can greatly reduce the amount of time needed to generate
		 output.  Defining the property <B>CIFhier</B> inside a cell
		 will override the use of <B>*hier write disable</B> and
		 force hierarchical output for that cell and its descendents.
	    <DT> <B>*array write</B> [ <B>enable</B> | <B>disable</B> ]
	    <DD> This sets a global option that enables (default) or disables
		 the generation of output CIF or GDS layers due to interaction
		 between components of subcell arrays.  If cells are known to
		 abut properly without generating spacing errors between them,
		 disabling hierarchical generation can greatly reduce the
		 amount of time needed to generate output.
		 Defining the property <B>CIFhier</B> inside a cell
		 will override the use of <B>*array write disable</B> and

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>cif</B> command reads CIF input or produces CIF input/output
      ("Caltech Intermediate Format", as described in Mead & Conway),
      or sets various parameters affecting the CIF (and GDS) input and
      output.  Certain <B>cif</B> command options also affect GDS input
      and output. <P>

      If no option is given, a CIF file is produced for the root cell,
      with the default name of the root cell definition and the
      filename extension ".cif". <P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cif</B> is implemented as a built-in function in <B>magic</B>.
      Options <B>list</B> and <B>listall</B> cause output to be
      returned as a Tcl result, rather than printed to stdout (the
      console).
