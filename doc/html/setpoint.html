<H2>setpoint</H2>
<HR>
Set the value of the cursor reference point in a specific window.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>setpoint</B> [<I>x y</I> [<I>window_id</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are screen coordinates and
	 <I>window_id</I> is the identifying number for a layout
	 window.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>setpoint</B> command forces the reference point for a specific
      window.  Each command that executes relative to a window must be able
      to translate from the pointer position to a layout coordinate.
      Commands that are executed from a script or from the command-line
      may not have access to the pointer, but can set the reference point
      with this command so that the effect of the command is predictable. <P>

      Normally, in interactive this command is not used.  However,
      scripts that open more than one window need to specify which one
      is to take the action of the command.  In the Tcl/Tk version, this
      can be done by using the <I>tk_path_name</I> command to pass a
      command to a specific window.  The non-Tcl/Tk version, and the Tcl/Tk
      version using the "-dnull" option on the command line (i.e., no
      graphics package initialized) must use the <B>setpoint</B> command
      to track windows.  Although possible, it is generally a bad idea
      for a script running in batch mode ("-dnull") to create and access
      multiple windows, since the window structures have no useful
      function outside of a graphics environment.  Nevertheless, it is
      important to realize that the <B>openwindow</B> command <I>will</I>
      generate multiple virtual windows in a batch-mode environment, and
      these can only be separately accessed using the <B>setpoint</B>
      command.

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>setpoint</B> is implemented as a built-in window command in <B>magic</B>.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Bugs:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The use of the window ID number is unique to this command and should
      be a window name like every other window-related command.  Likewise,
      scripts would best make use of this command if the position were in
      layout coordinates, and <B>magic</B> translated them back to screen
      coordinates in the indicated window to set the reference point.
