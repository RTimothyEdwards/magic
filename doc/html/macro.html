Define or print a macro called char

<H3>Usage:</H3>

      <B>macro</B> [<I>window_type</I>] [<I>key</I> [<I>value</I>]] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	 where <I>key</I> is the name of a valid key (see below), and
	 <I>value</I> is a <B>magic</B> command-line command.  If
	 present, <I>window_type</I> must be one of the four window
	 types accepted by the <B>specialopen</B> command:  <B>layout</B>,
	 <B>color</B>, <B>netlist</B>, and <B>wind3d</B>.  If omitted,
	 the layout window is assumed by default, unless the command has
	 been called from inside a window (using the colon or semicolon
	 escape to the command-line), in which case that window type is
	 assumed.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>macro</B> command translates keystrokes typed into
      a layout window into <B>magic</B> command-line commands.
      When the key <I>key</I> is pressed in a layout window, the
      command stored in <I>value</I> is executed relative to that
      layout window.  The default bindings are specified in the
      system <TT>.magic</TT> file, read at startup.  These macros
      may be arbitrarily rebound using the <B>macro</B> command. <P>

      A key <B>macro</B> may be unbound from a command by
      passing an empty string ("") for the <I>value</I>. <P>

      <I>key</I> is any valid name for a keyboard keypress event.
      In its simplest form, this may just be the name of the key,
      such as "g" or "X".  The space bar key must be quoted in
      double-quotes;  most other characters may be unquoted.
      Control characters may be specified by the two-character
      combination of the carat ("^") key followed by a capital
      letter, such as "^Z".  The use of embedded control characters
      is deprecated, as it is incompatible with Tcl syntax. <P>

      <I>key</I> may also be specified as any valid X11 name for
      a key as defined in the include file <TT>keysymdef.h</TT>
      on UNIX systems.  This allows specification of function
      keys such as "XK_F8" or keypad keys such as "XK_KP_Right". <P>

      Buttons are treated just like keys for the purpose of
      defining macros.  While the official names for buttons
      in <TT>keysymdef.h</TT> are "<B>XK_Pointer_Button_1</B>",
      etc., the <B>macro</B> command accepts the abbreviated
      forms <B>Button1</B>, and so forth. <P>


      Finally, key modifiers may be prepended to the key name.
      Valid key modifiers are <B>Shift_</B>, <B>Control_</B>,
      <B>Alt_</B>, and <B>Meta_</B>, and may be coupled in any
      combination.  Mouse buttons may also be combined with key
      modifiers, so, for example, <B>Shift_Button1</B> is a legal,
      unique binding. <P>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>macro</B> is implemented as a built-in window command in <B>magic</B>.
