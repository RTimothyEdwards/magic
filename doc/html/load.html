         where <I>cellname</I> is the name of a cell that presumably
	 exists either in the database memory or on disk as a
	 <TT>.mag</TT> file.  <I>n</I> and <I>d</I>
	 are the numerator and denominator, respectively, of a 
	 magnification factor, if it is desired to load the cell at a
	 different scale than it was written.  <I>d</I> defaults to 1
	 if not specified.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>load</B> command loads a cell into the database and
      displays it in the current layout window (if available).  If
      the cell is not already in the database memory, it is loaded
      from disk.  If it cannot be found on disk, then a new cell
      definition of name <I>cellname</I> is created and loaded
      into the window. <P>

      By default, <B>magic</B> loads a cell from disk only if the
      technology name matches the current technology.  Historically,
      this has led to most technologies being named "scmos" which
      undermines the purpose of having a technology name in the
      first place.  In magic-7.2 and 7.3, this behavior can be
      overridden with the <B>-force</B> option.  <B>magic</B> will
      read the cell to the extent that layer names match between
      the current technology and the technology of the file. <P>

      The <B>-force</B> option and <B>scaled</B> option can be
      used together to port layouts from one technology to
      another.  The <B>scaled</B> option implements a scale
      conversion during input by redefining the ratio of lambda
      to internal units during the load.  This is useful if
      a cell was written in a lambda-based technology but needs
      to be read into a vendor-rules-based technology with a
      fine internal scale such as 0.1 micron per internal unit.
      The <B>scaled</B> option may also be used simply to resize
      cell geometry, although this is generally only useful to
      do for layout such as logos and text lettering drawn in
      routing layers. <P>

      The <B>-quiet</B> option prevents magic from generating error
      messages during loads.  This can be used to prevent magic from
      complaining that a file does not exist when "<B>load</B>" is
      being used to create a new cell, rather than load one from
      disk. <P>

      By default, if a cell cannot be found in the search path, then
      a new empty layout is created with the name of the specified
      cell.  The <B>-fail</B> option prevents magic from creating a
      new cell.  Instead, if the cell cannot be found in the search
      path, the load will simply fail. <P>

      Since version 8.2.50, magic saves the path to each subcell
      used in a design in the .mag file, to help with version
      control.  This breaks backwards compatibility with the
      traditional <B>load</B> command, which would always use
      the search paths set by the <A HREF=addpath.html><B>addpath</B></A>
      command.  The <B>-dereference</B> option restores the
      traditional behavior by ignoring all path references in the
      input file and relying only on known search paths to locate
      the source file for each subcell in the layout. <P>

      Note that if it is not desired to have <I>cellname</I>
      created if not found on disk (e.g., because the path for
      the cell was missing from the search path), the database
      can be updated with the <B>flush</B> command or the
      <B>cellname delete</B> command. <P>

      Use of <B>load</B> with no <I>cellname</I> given will result in
      creating a new cell called "<TT>(UNNAMED)</TT>". <P>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>load</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
