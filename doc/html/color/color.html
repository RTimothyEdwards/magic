      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>number</I> is the number of a color in the colormap list.
	 Historically, this number was given in octal.  This has been changed
	 to the variable format of C syntax, in which numbers are treated as
	 decimal unless beginning with "0" (zero), in which case they are
	 treated as octal, or "0x" (zero-x), in which case they are treated
	 as hexidecimal.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>color</B> command specifies the color number to edit in
      the colormap window.  With no arguments, prints the color
      index and RGB values for the color being edited. <P>

      In the Tcl-based version of magic, the "color picking" and
      "color copying" functions are no longer functional.  For
      this reason, options <B>color next</B> and <B>color last</B>
      have been added to allow scrolling through the colors in the
      colormap.  These commands are bound to the key macros
      "<B>+</B>" (plus) and "<B>-</B>" (minus), respectively. <P>

      Options <B>color get</B> and <B>color rgb</B> return subsets
      of the information reported by <B>color</B> with no arguments.
      <B>color get</B> returns the color index of the color, and
      <B>color rgb</B> returns the individual red, green, and blue
      intensities of the color.  In the Tcl-based version of <B>magic</B>,
      these values are returned as Tcl results. <P>

      Note that color changes made in the <B>color</B> window do not
      immediately take effect on the layout.  It is necessary to pass
      a <B>refresh</B> command to the layout window, or to type the
      <I>Control-</I><B>L</B> macro in the layout window to update
      the colors.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>color</B> is implemented as a built-in <B>color</B>
	window command in <B>magic</B>.  It can only be invoked from
	a window created with the <B>specialopen color</B> command.
