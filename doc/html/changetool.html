      <BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>tool</B> command selects or queries the mode of operation
      of the mouse buttons in the layout window.  Each <I>tool</I>
      type has a unique set of button bindings. <P>

      Without arguments, the <B>tool</B> command selects the next
      tool type in round-robin fashion.  With a tool type as argument,
      the button bindings switch to those for the indicated tool.
      With the <B>info</B> option, a summary of the commands bound to
      each mouse button is given for the current tool. <P>

      The default mouse bindings for each of the three tools is as follows:
      <UL>
	<LI><I>Box Tool</I>
	  <DL>
	    <DT> <B>left</B>
	    <DD> Move the box so its lower-left corner is at cursor position
	    <DT> <B>right</B>
	    <DD> Resize box by moving upper-right corner to cursor position
	    <DT> <B>middle</B>
	    <DD> Paint box area with material underneath cursor
	  </DL>
	  In addition, you can move or resize the box by different corners
	  by pressing left or right, holding it down, moving the cursor
	  near a different corner and clicking the other (left or right)
	  button down then up without releasing the initial button.
	<LI><I>Wiring Tool</I>
	  <DL>
	    <DT> <B>left</B>
	    <DD> Pick wire material and size from under the cursor and begin
	    	 interactive wire placement.
	    <DT> <B>right</B>
	    <DD> Cancel interactive wire placement.
	    <DT> <B>middle</B>
	    <DD> Place a wire at the position shown by the interactive wire
	    	 tool highlight box, and continue interactive wire placement.
	    <DT> <I>shift-</I><B>left</B>
	    <DD> Change the type of wire to the next plane (e.g., metal1 to metal2)
	    <DT> <I>shift-</I><B>right</B>
	    <DD> Change the type of wire to the previous plane (e.g., metal2 to metal1)
	    <DT> <I>shift-</I><B>middle</B>
	    <DD> Place a contact at the current location and switch to the wire
	    	 type on the next plane.
	    <DT> <B>scrollwheel up<B>
	    <DD> Increase the wire size by one unit
	    <DT> <B>scrollwheel down<B>
	    <DD> Decrease the wire size by one unit
	  </DL>
	  Note that the methods for the wire tool differ significantly between
	  Tcl-based magic, with its interactive capabilities, and non-Tcl-based
	  magic.
	<LI><I>Netlist Tool</I>
	  <DL>
	    <DT> <B>left</B>
	    <DD> Select the net containing the terminal nearest the cursor
	    <DT> <B>right</B>
	    <DD> Toggle the terminal nearest the cursor into/out of current net
	    <DT> <B>middle</B>
	    <DD> Join current net and net containing terminal nearest the cursor
	  </DL>
	<LI><I>Pick Tool</I>
	  <DL>
	    <DT> <B>left</B>
	    <DD> Remove the current selection from the layout, place it
	    	 in the pick buffer, and follow the cursor.
	    <DT> <B>right</B>
	    <DD> Cancel the current pick buffer and stop following the
	    	 cursor.
	    <DT> <B>middle</B>
	    <DD> Place a copy of the pick buffer at the current location,
	    	 and continue following the cursor.
	    <DT> <I>shift-</I><B>middle</B>
	    <DD> Make a copy of the current selection from the layout,
	    	 place it in the pick buffer, and follow the cursor.
	  </DL>
	  The pick tool is an interactive feature only available in the
	  Tcl-based version of magic.
      </UL>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>tool</B> is implemented as a Tcl script in the Tcl-based
      version of <B>magic</B>.  The command duplicates the function of
      the original <B>tool</B> command, which remains for the non-Tcl
      based version of magic, and which performs the function of
      changing the cursor style in the window. <P>

      Button functions for each "tool" may be added to or modified in
      the startup scripts.  The Tcl variable <B>Opts(tool)</B> contains
      the current tool name, and may be used by a user <B>tool</B>
      procedure overriding the default one in "tools.tcl".
