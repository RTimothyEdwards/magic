<H2>joinnets</H2>
<HR>
Join the nets containing the two indicated terminals.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>joinnets</B> <I>term1 term2</I> <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>term1</I> and <I>term2</I> are names of netlist
	 terminals.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>joinnets</B> command joins two networks together into a single
      network.  The two networks are specified by naming a terminal on
      each network.  If either terminal is not connected to a network,
      no action is taken (use the <B>add</B> command to add an
      unconnected terminal to a network).
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>joinnets</B> is implemented as a built-in <B>netlist</B>
	window command in <B>magic</B>.  It can only be invoked from
	a window created with the <B>specialopen netlist</B> command.
	This command was previously called <B>join</B>, and may be
	used as that abbreviation in the non-Tcl version of <B>magic</B>.
	However, the command name <B>join</B> conflicts with the Tcl
	command of the same name, and its syntax is not distinct.
	Therefore, in Tcl-based <B>magic</B>, the command name <B>join</B>
	is interpreted as the Tcl command.
