<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>property</B> command implements a general-purpose method
      of attaching information to a cell definition.  Except for a
      few properties known to the <B>lef</B>, <B>extract</B>, and
      <B>gds</B> commands (q.v.), properties have no inherent meaning
      to magic but may be used with other programs or scripts to add
      additional information about a cell definition. <P>

      With no arguments, all properties of the current edit cell are
      listed.  With only the <I>key</I> argument, the value associated
      with the key is returned.  With both arguments, the string
      <I>value</I> is associated with the string <I>key</I> as a
      property of the cell.  If <I>key</I> is an existing key, then
      its original value will be overwritten.

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Property names reserved by and used by magic:
      <DL>
	<DT> <B>GDS_FILE</B>
	<DD> The value is the name of a GDS file which contains the mask
	     data for the cell.  The cell is then effectively an abstract
	     view, because its contents are in the GDS file and do not
	     necessarily match what is displayed (although they might).
	<DT> <B>GDS_START</B>
	<DD> If a <B>GDS_FILE</B> is defined, then this value indicates the
	     byte position of the start of mask data for this cell definition
	     in the file.  If set to value <B>0</B>, then the file will be
	     searched for the data bounds.
	<DT> <B>GDS_END</B>
	<DD> If a <B>GDS_FILE</B> is defined, then this value indicates the
	     byte position of the end of mask data for this cell definition
	     in the file.  If <B>GDS_START</B> is set to <B>0</B>, then this
	     property may be omitted.
	<DT> <B>LEFview</B>
	<DD> If set to <B>TRUE</B>, this cell is an abstract view such as that
	     obtained from a LEF macro, and should not be used for extraction
	     or for writing mask data (unless <B>GDS_FILE</B> is defined).
	<DT> <B>LEFproperties</B>
	<DD> If the file was read from a LEF macro, then this property corresponds
	     to the LEF <B>PROPERTY</B> block values.  All values from the block
	     are contatenated into the single property string.
	<DT> <B>LEFsymmetry</B>
	<DD> If the file was read from a LEF macro, then this property corresponds
	     to the macro's <B>SYMMETRY</B> value.
	<DT> <B>LEFclass</B>
	<DD> If the file was read from a LEF macro, then this property corresponds
	     to the macro's <B>CLASS</B> value.
	<DT> <B>LEFsite</B>
	<DD> If the file was read from a LEF macro, then this property corresponds
	     to the macro's <B>SITE</B> value.
	<DT> <B>CIFhier</B>
	<DD> If defined, then this cell will be written to CIF or GDS
	     output with hierachical processing regardless of the settings of
	     the command options "cif *hier write disable" and "cif *array write
	     disable".  That allows those commands to be used to avoid
	     time-consuming and unnecessary hierarchical processing of a top-level
	     chip assembly with mostly correct-by-design components (such as a
	     digital standard cell layout) while preserving necessary hierarchical
	     processing on blocks (such as analog circuits) that need them.
	<DT> <B>FIXED_BBOX</B>
	<DD> This property value is a space-separated list of four integer values
	     corresponding to the abutment box of the cell, in magic's internal
	     units.  The abutment box is automatically read from LEF files, but
	     may be defined for any file and can be used for placement alignment.
	<DT> <B>OBS_BBOX</B>
	<DD> This property value is a space-sparated list of four integer values
	     corresponding to a bounding box to be used when generating a LEF
	     file abstract view of a cell.  The area inside the bounding box
	     will be entirely covered in obstruction layers (unless cut-outs
	     are required to accommodate pins).  Any set-back applied by the
	     "lef write -hide <value>" option will be applied to this obstruction
	     box.
	<DT> <B>flatten</B>
	<DD> This property is used in conjunction with the "flatten -doproperty"
	     command option and marks the cell for flattening.  Cells without
	     this property defined will not be flattened.
	<DT> <B>device</B>
	<DD> This property declares that the cell is a device or contains a
	     single device that is not a known extractable device defined in
	     the technology file.  In the first case, the device to be extracted
	     is a subcircuit and the name of the device is the same as the name
	     of the cell.  In this case, the property value should begin with
	     "<B>primitive</B>".  This may be followed by any parameters
	     associated with the device that need to be output in the netlist;
	     e.g., "<B>primitive nf=4</B>.  When the cell is recast as a
	     primitive device, it is necessary for the port order in the cell
	     to match the port order of the device as it must appear in the
	     output netlist.  In the second case, the device to be extracted
	     is either a low-level component type (not a subcircuit), or is a
	     subcircuit with a different name than the cell.  In that case, the
	     value string should be the text of the line as it should appear
	     in a "<B>device</B>" line in the output <TT>.ext</TT> file when the
	     cell is extracted.  That includes the names of all ports and any
	     parameters to be output.  As the output device is defined inside
	     the subcircuit of the cell in which it is defined, the ports may
	     be reordered between the subcircuit and the instantiation of the
	     device.  The use of either form of the <B>device</B> property
	     precludes the generation of parasitics associated with the cell.
	     All parasitics are assumed to be included in the device model.
	<DT> <B>parameter</B>
	<DD> If, when an instance of the cell's subcircuit is generated in the
	     output netlist, the instance should be passed one or more
	     parameters, then those parameter <I>key</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>
	     pairs (as a single, space-separated string) should be defined as
	     the value to the <B>parameter</B> property.
        <DT> <B>MASKHINTS_</B><I>type</I>
	<DD> The value is a string of consecutive sets of four integer values,
	     each set representing the bounding box of a rectangle defining
	     the area of CIF type <I>type</I>, in magic's internal units.
	     This indicates that magic will
	     always generate mask layer <I>type</I> in the specified rectangle
	     area when writing GDS or CIF output.  <I>type</I> may be a templayer,
	     such that <I>type</I> could be defined as the absence of a mask layer,
	     for example.

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>property</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
      The property structure itself is implemented as a hash table in
      the cell definition structure.
