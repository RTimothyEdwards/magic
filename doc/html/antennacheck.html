<H2>antennacheck</H2>
<HR>
Run antenna violation checks on the current edit cell.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>antennacheck</B> [<I>option</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> may be one of the following:
	 <DL>
	   <DT> <B>run</B>
	   <DD> "<B>antennacheck run</B>" is equivalent to "<B>antennacheck</B>"
		with no arguments, and causes an antenna violation check to be
		run.
	   <DT> <B>debug</B>
	   <DD> Sets up debug mode for the next antenna run.  In addition to
		feedback entries, additional information will be printed to
		the terminal about each error encountered.

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>antennacheck</B> command runs a full check for antenna violations
      on the entire area of the cell being edited.  Antenna violations are
      defined in the technology file as the ratios of metal area to sensitive
      MOSFET transistor gate areas to which the metal is attached.  The antenna
      effect is a manufacturing problem caused by charge buildup on gates
      during metal etching.  The metal being etched forms an antenna that
      gathers charge on the net connected to the gate.  If the area of metal
      is large enough the gate can be destroyed by the process of etching.
      The foundry specifies what the area ratio limit must be.  The check is
      done progressively from the lowest metal layer to the highest.  If
      violations are found, then feedback entries are created covering the
      area of both the gate and the metal layer at which the violation occurred.
      <P>

      The <B>extract</B> command must be run prior to <B>antennacheck</B> to
      obtain the extracted characteristics of the design, so that all
      sensitive transistor gates can be identified and enumerated. <P>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>antennacheck</B> is implemented as a built-in <B>magic</B> command.
      The <B>antennacheck</B> command was introduced in magic version
      8.2.150 along with technology file extensions to support the antenna
      rule violations (see the online Maintainer's Manual #2).
