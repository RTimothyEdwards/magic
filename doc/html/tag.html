<H2>tag</H2>
<HR>
Register a tag callback command.
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>tag</B> <I>command_name</I> [<I>procedure</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>command_name</I> is the name of any <B>magic</B>
	 command, and <I>procedure</I> is any valid Tcl procedure.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>tag</B> command is registers callback procedures to be
      executed after the indicated <B>magic</B> command has been
      executed.  The primary use of the <B>tag</B> command is to
      register procedures that update the GUI window in response
      to commands that are typed on the command line or generated
      from macro calls. <P>

      In keeping with standard methods for Tcl callback functions,
      certain "escape sequences" beginning with the percent ("<B>%</B>")
      character are allowed to be embedded in the callback function
      <I>procedure</I>, and are substituted prior to execution, with
      the substitutions defined as follows:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <DL>
	<DT> <B>%W</B>
	<DD> Substitute the Tk path of the layout window from which
	     or in reference to which <I>command_name</I> was invoked.
	<DT> <B>%r</B>
	<DD> Substitute the previous Tcl result string, but do not reset
	     the Tcl result of the execution of <I>procedure</I>.
	<DT> <B>%R</B>
	<DD> Substitute the previous Tcl result string and reset the Tcl
	     result from the execution of <I>procedure</I> such that the
	     the result of <I>command_name</I> becomes the result of
	     <I>procedure</I>.
	<DT> <B>%</B>[<B>0</B>-<B>5</B>]
	<DD> Substitute the zeroth to fifth argument to the original command.
	<DT> <B>%%</B>
	<DD> Substitute a single percent character.
	<DT> <B>%</B><I>char</I>
	<DD> where <I>char</I> is any character not defined above: No action,
	     print exactly as written.
      </DL>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      When a tag callback is used, the return value seen by the interpreter
      is the return value of the function <I>procedure</I>, not the return
      value of the tagged command <I>command_name</I>.  The escape sequence
      <B>%R</B> can be used to force the result of <I>command_name</I> to
      become the result of <I>procedure</I> (unless <I>procedure</I>
      produces an error condition, in which case the error is returned).
      The escape sequence <I>%r</I> passes the result of <I>command_name</I>
      as an argument to the procedure, which may choose to return it as
      a result, or not. <P>

      If no <I>procedure</I> is present, then the <B>tag</B> command
      returns whatever procedure string is attached to the indicated
      <I>command_name</I>, if any.  This can be used as a way to prevent
      infinite recursion inside a tag callback; for example,
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         <B>set savetag [tag callback </B><I>command</I><B>]</B> <BR>
	 <I>(procedure calls, which may include a call to </I>command<I>)</I> <BR>
	 <B>tag</B> <I>command</I> <B>$savetag</B>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Another way to avoid infinite recursion is to check the procedure
      depth from within the tag callback procedure using the Tcl command
      "<B>info level</B>", to avoid executing the callback procedure if
      the level is not zero. <P>

      Only one tag callback is allowed per command name.  However, only
      one is needed as that procedure may call as many other procedures
      as it wants to.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>tag</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>,
      but only in the Tcl version.
