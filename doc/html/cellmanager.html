<H2>cellmanager</H2>
<HR>
Invoke the cell manager GUI window
<HR>

<H3>Shortcuts:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Menu option <I>Options->Cell Manager</I> implements the command
      <B>cellmanager create</B> in the GUI layout window.  This menu
      item has a checkbox and is used both to open and to close the
      Cell Manager window.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cellmanager</B> [<I>option</I>] <BR><BR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
         where <I>option</I> is optional and may be one of the following:
	 <DL>
	    <DT> <B>update</B>
	    <DD> The default option if no option is given.  Update the
		 cell manager to reflect the current state of the layout.
	    <DT> <B>create</B>
	    <DD> Create the cell manager window.  This option is normally
		 called only from the "<I>Cell Manager</I>" button in the
		 <B>magic</B> GUI layout window.
	 </DL>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>cellmanager</B> command is normally invoked automatically
      from inside the GUI wrapper procedures and tag callbacks, and
      normally should not be called directly from the command line.

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The Cell Manager window (see above) is a separate top-level window
      with Tk pathname "<B>.cellmgr</B>".  It consists of a tree widget
      (defined in the Tcl package "BLT") display in the center, a message
      window and button on the bottom, and a row of menu buttons at the
      top. <P>

      The Cell Manager displays cells for everything stored in the layout
      database.  As such, it is only necessary to have a single cell
      manager for all layout windows.  However, commands such as "Load",
      "Edit", etc., apply to a specific window.  When a new layout window
      is created, rather than generate a new Cell Manager window, the
      new window is added to the list of "target windows".  The currently
      selected target window is displayed at the bottom of the Cell
      Manager.  This is also a button that can be used to select a new
      target window.  If only one layout window is present, the target is
      declared "default" and may be left alone. <P>

      The hierarchical tree view shows all of the <I>instances</I> (cell
      uses) in a layout.  When first invoked, the top-level cell only
      is shown, with a "folder" icon showing that this cell contains
      uses.  By clicking on the "+" symbol next to the folder icon,
      the tree view is expanded to show the cell instances used by the
      top-level layout cell.  This expansion may continue until a cell
      instance is found that does not contain any descendents.  Note that
      the name displayed is the name of the cell <I>definition</I>, with
      the instance number given in parentheses after the name.  If
      the instance name is non-default (e.g., because it came from a
      3rd party vendor database or was altered with the <B>identify</B>
      command), the full name of the instance is shown in the
      parentheses.  If the instance is arrayed, the array indices are
      shown in brackets ("<B>[]</B>") after the instance number or name.
      <P>

      The use of tag callbacks on commands allows the cell manager to
      be updated in response to certain commands entered on the command
      line.  The cell manager will be updated in response to a
      "<B>load</B>" or "<B>getcell</B>" command. <P>

      The menu buttons perform certain functions based on the selection
      made in the tree window.  These functions are as follows:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <DL>
	 <DT> <B>Load</B>
	 <DD> load the selected cell into the window.  The <B>load</B>
	      command is invoked and passed the cell definition name
	      of the selected cell instance.  Note that this menu
	      function operates on the cell <I>definition</I> of the
	      selected cell <I>instance</I>.
	 <DT> <B>Edit</B>
	 <DD> edit the selected cell instance.  The cell instance
	      selected becomes the current edit cell.
	 <DT> <B>Expand</B>
	 <DD> expand (or unexpand, if already expanded) the selected
	      cell instance.
	 <DT> <B>Zoom</B>
	 <DD> change the current view of the layout so that it is
	      centered on the selected cell instance, and scaled so
	      that the cell instance fills the screen.
      </DL>

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>cellmanager</B> is implemented as a Tcl procedure in the GUI wrapper
	script.  Because layouts with complicated hierarchy can cause
	<B>magic</B> to run very slowly due to processing in the cell
	manager window, this window does not exist on startup and is
	deleted entirely when turned off in the "<I>Options</I>" menu of
	the GUI wrapper layout window. <P>
      <B>cellmanager</B> uses the tree display widget from the tcl package
	"BLT".  Therefore, in order to see the Cell Manager window, it is
	necessary to have BLT installed on the system.  If BLT is not
	installed, no option for "Cell Manager" will appear in the "Options"
	menu of the GUI wrapper window. <P>
      <B>cellmanager</B> depends on the GUI wrapper window, as it is defined
	in the wrapper script.  Therefore, to use the cell manager, it is
	necessary to invoke magic with the option "<B>-w</B>".
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Bugs:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
   The "<B>Expand</B>" function should expand everything above the selected
   cell.  Otherwise, if something higher up in the hierarchy is unexpanded,
   the selected cell will not be expanded.
