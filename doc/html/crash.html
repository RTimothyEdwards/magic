Handle crash backup files
<HR>

<H3>Usage:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>crash save</B> | <B>recover</B> [<I>filename</I>] <BR><BR>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Summary:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      The <B>crash</B> command handles crash backup files.  The exact
      operation depends on the options, and are outlined below:
      <DL>
      	<DT> <B>crash save</B>
	<DD> creates and writes to a single file a copy of the contents
		of all modified cells.  If <B>crash save</B> has been
		called previously, then the filename specified or
		generated will be used again.  If this is the first
		call to <B>crash save</B>, or if the previous call was
		<B>crash save ""</B>, then a new, unique filename of
		a file in the system temporary directory (normally
		"<TT>/tmp</TT>") is created and remembered for subsequent
		calls to <B>crash save</B>.
      	<DT> <B>crash save</B> <I>filename</I>
	<DD> creates and writes to the file <I>filename</I> a copy of
		the contents of all modified cells.  <I>filename</I>
		is retained as the crash filename, so subsequent uses
		of <B>crash save</B> without a filename specified will
		also write to this file.
      	<DT> <B>crash save ""</B>
	<DD> causes magic to forget the name of the crash file.  The
		next use of <B>crash save</B> without a filename will
		revert to the behavior of generating a unique filename
		in the system temporary directory.
      	<DT> <B>crash recover</B>
	<DD> searches the system temporary directory for magic crash
		recovery files.  If one or more such files is found,
		then the user is prompted for the action of either
		recovering or ignoring the most recent file found.
		If the chosen action is to recover the file, then the
		contents of the saved crash file are loaded into the
		database, and the file is removed.
      	<DT> <B>crash recover</B> <I>filename</I>
	<DD> recovers the database from the contents of the saved crash
		file <I>filename</I> upon successful read-in, the file
		<I>filename</I> is removed. <B>
      </DL>

      If a crash file has been generated during a layout editing session,
      and magic is exited normally with the "quit" command, then the
      crash backup file is removed. <P>

      For backward-compatibility, crash backup files are always generated
      when magic receives a SIGTERM signal.  In the non-Tcl version of
      magic, periodic backups are not made.

<H3>Implementation Notes:</H3>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>crash</B> is implemented as a built-in command in <B>magic</B>.
      The Tcl/Tk version defines various scripts in "tools.tcl" that
      implement a periodic backup using the <B>crash</B> command.
      Invoking magic on the command-line using "<B>magic -r</B>" is
      equivalent to starting magic followed by the command
      "<B>crash recover</B>".
