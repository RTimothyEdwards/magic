 * One of the biggest consumers of memory space when flattening a circuit
 * are the full hierarchical names of all nodes.  Most of this space is
 * wasted since it's redundant.  Also, a lot of time is spent comparing
 * long names whose initial components are identical.
 *
 * The following structure allows hierarchical names to be represented
 * with sharing.  Names are represented as a sequence of components,
 * from the lowest level of the hierarchy pointing back toward the root.
 * Hence, comparisons are likely to detect differences between names
 * early on.  Second, many children can share the same parent, so
 * storage space should be comparable to that needed for an unflattened
 * hierarchy (with arrays flattened, however).
