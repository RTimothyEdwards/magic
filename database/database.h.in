 * each possible TileType.
 *
 * A negative value of TileType implies an error condition when received
 * from a routine returning a TileType.  Care should be taken to ensure
 * that a negative TileType is never used to index an array!
 *
 * The last TT_RESERVEDTYPES tile types are reserved for use by clients.
 * Because unsigned chars are used to hold tile types (PaintResultType),
 * this number should not be increased without changing the definition
 * of PaintResultType later in this file.
 *
 * (Magic v.7.1) Macros are generated by script scripts/makedbh,
 * with each macro appropriately constructed for the value of
 * TT_MAXTYPES.
 *
 * Each addition of a word to the bitmask increases computation
 * time on all plane operations in magic!  Choose the smallest number
 * required for the technology files used.  The obvious reaonable values
 * to choose are 96, 192, 256, or 512, corresponding to word array sizes

 * Here's a brief note about how to interpret TileTypeBitMasks:
 * The default TT_MAXTYPES = 256 translates to 8 words.  As an
 * example, to examine TileTypeBitMask DBConnectTbl[65]
 * (in this example DBTypeLongNameTbl[65]="metal1").  In gdb,
 * use "print /x DBConnectTbl[65]" to get:
 *
 * $2 = {tt_words = {0x59800000, 0xc8cc22a6, 0x8000003b, 0xff800008, \
 *	0x38f, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}}
 *
 * The first word represents types 0-31 (lsb to msb, respectively),
 * the second work represents types 32-63, and so forth.  From this
 * result we see that metal1 (type 65) connects to types 23, 24, 27,
 * 28, and 30 (from the 1st word), 33, 34, 37, 39, 41, and so on.
 * A quick check of DBTypeLongNameTbl[] shows that these types are
 * ndc, pdc, psc, nsc, and so forth.

 *	CDINTERNAL means that this cell is used internally by Magic (e.g.
 *	    for DRC checking or channel decomposition or selection) and
 *	    has nothing to do with the user's layout.  Many things don't
 *	    apply to internal cells (such as design-rule checking).

 *	CDBOXESCHANGED means that bounding boxes of one or more children

 *	CDFIXEDBBOX means that this cell has been declared to be a
 *	    pre-extracted subcircuit, so the bounding box should not
 *	    be altered.
 *	CDNOEDIT means that the cell cannot be edited because its file
 *	    is read-only or (if FILE_LOCKS enabled) locked by another user.
 *	CDPROCESSED means that the cell bounding box has been calculated
 *	    and should not be calculated again.
 *	CDFLATGDS is set when the "calma flatten" option is chosen and
 *	    a cell is small and does not call any instances itself.
 *	    The flag is used to identify the cell and remove it after GDS
 *	    input processing.
 *	CDFLATTENED is set when a cell marked CDFLATGDS is used.  Cells
 *	    that are never used are not removed after processing.
 *	CDPROCESSEDGDS is set when the cell read from the GDS stream file
 *	    is added to the magic database.  The flag is used to identify
 *	    whether the cell has been processed when forcing the GDS
 *	    stream data to be read in post-order.
 *	CDVENDORGDS indicates that the cell was read from a GDS stream
 *	    with the option "gds readonly true".

 *	xlo'	index of leftmost array element in root coordinates

 *
 * User supplies:
 *	xsep'	(positive) X spacing between array elements in root coords
 *	ysep'	(positive) Y spacing between array elements in root coords

 * element of the array is gotten by transforming the celldef by the
 * transformation in the celluse.  the [x, y] element is gotten by
