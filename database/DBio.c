 * dbCellReadDef --
 *
 *
 * Read in the paint for a cell from its associated disk file.
 * If a filename for the cell is specified, we try to open it
 * somewhere in the search path.  Otherwise, we try the filename
 * already associated with the cell, or the name of the cell itself
 * as the name of the file containing the definition of the cell.
 *
 * Mark the cell definition as "read in" (CDAVAILABLE), and
 * recompute the bounding box.
 *
 *				WARNING:
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the caller to call DBReComputeBbox(cellDef)
 * at a convenient place, as we do not set the bounding box of the cell def.
 * If we were to update the bounding box here, this CellDef would first have
 * to be ripped out of each parent subcell tile plane in which it appears, and
 * then relinked in after its bounding box had changed.  Since DBCellRead() may
 * be called from in the middle of a database search, however, the database
 * modification resulting from this could ruin the search context and crash
 * the system.
 *
 * Results:
 *	TRUE if the cell could be read successfully, FALSE
 *	otherwise.
 *
 * Side effects:
 	Clears the cell's MODIFIED bit.
 *	Updates the tile planes for the cell definition.
 *	In the event of an error while reading in the cell,
 *	the external integer errno is set to the UNIX error
 *	encountered.
 *
 *	If newTechOk is TRUE and the cell's technology is different
 *	from the current one, the current technology is changed.
 *
 * Errors:
 *	If incomplete specs are given either for a rectangle or for
 *	a cell use, then we immediately stop reading the file.
 *
 * File Format:
 *
 *	1. The first line of the file contains the string "magic".
 *
 *	2. Next comes an optional technology line, with the format
 *	"tech <tech>".  <tech> is the technology of the cell.
 *
 *	3. Next comes an optional scale line, with the format
 *	"magscale <n> <d>".  <n> and <d> give the number of magic
 *	internal units per lambda as the ratio <n>/<d>.  If this
 *	line is absent, the scale ratio is assumed to be 1-to-1.
 *
 *	4. Next comes an optional line giving the cell's timestamp
 *	(the last time it or any of its children changed, as far as
 *	we know).  The syntax is "timestamp <value>", where <value>
 *	is an integer as returned by the library function time().
 *
 *	5. Next come groups of lines describing rectangles of the
 *	Magic tile types.  Each group is headed with a line of the
 *	form "<< layer >>".	The layer name is matched against the
 *	current technology.  Each line after the header has the
 *	format "rect <xbot> <ybot> <xtop> <ytop>".
 *	Nonmanhattan geometry is covered by the entry
 *	"tri <xbot> <ybot> <xtop> <ytop> <dir>" with <dir> indicating
 *	the direction of the corner made by the right triangle.
 *	If the split tile contains more than one type, separate entries
 *	are output for each.
 *
 *	6. Zero or more groups of lines describing cell uses.  Each group
 *	is of the form
 *		use <filename> <id> [<path>]
 *		array <xlo> <xhi> <xsep> <ylo> <yhi> <ysep>
 *		timestamp <int>
 *		transform <a> <b> <c> <d> <e> <f>
 *		box <xbot> <ybot> <xtop> <ytop>
 *	Each group may be preceded by one or more separator lines.  Note
 *	that <id> is optional and is omitted if there is to be no
 *	instance id for the cell use.  If it is omitted, an instance
 *	identifier is generated internally.  The "array" line may be
 *	omitted	if the cell use is not an array.  The "timestamp" line is
 *	optional;  if present, it gives the last time the parent
 *	was aware that the child changed.  The <path> is a full path
 *	to the location of the cell <id>.  <path> will be interpreted
 *	relative to the parent cell (the .mag file being read) if it
 *	does not begin with "/" or "~/".  Only the first instance of a
 *	cell needs to declare <path>.  If omitted completely, the cell
 *	is searched for in the search paths declared using the "addpath"
 *	command, which is the original, backwardly-compatible behavior.
 *	The new behavior using <path>, introduced in magic-8.2, implies
 *	that (apart from backwardly-compatible use) the search path only
 *	pertains to cells imported using "getcell", while cells named in
 *	database files are version controlled by specifically naming the
 *	path to the file.  If no cell <id> exists at <path>, then the
 *	fall-back method is to use the search paths, which allows some
 *	portability of layouts from place to place without breaking.
 *
 *	7. If the cell contains labels, then the labels are preceded
 *	by the line "<< labels >>".  Each label is one line of the form
 *		rlabel <layer> [s] <xbot> <ybot> <xtop> <ytop> <position> <text>
 *		 or
 *		flabel <layer> [s] <xbot> <ybot> <xtop> <ytop> <position> <fontname>
 *			<size> <rotation> <offsetx> <offsety> <text>
 *		 or
 *		label <layer> <x> <y> <position> <text>
 *	(the last form is obsolete and is for point labels only).
 *
 *	Ports are declared in the label line after the label they refer
 *	to.  The syntax is
 *		port <index> <dirs>
 *	where <dir> is a string with one to four characters "nsew",
 *	denoting the position of allowed connections to the port.  The
 *	index must be unique to each port in a cell.
 *
 *	9. Elements are saved in a section "<< elements >>".
 *
 *     10. The file is terminated by the line "<< end >>".
 *
 *	Note: be careful about any changes to this format:  there are
 *	several previous file formats still in use in old files, and
 *	the current one is backwardly compatible with all of them.

 * updated where appropriate.
 *
 * This code is fairly tricky to ensure that we never destroy the
 * original contents of a cell in the event of an I/O error.  We
 * try the following approaches in order.
 *
 *  1.	If we can create a temporary file in the same directory as the
 *	target cell, do so.  Then write to the temporary file and rename
 *	it to the target cell name.
 *
 *  2.	If we can't create the above temporary file, open the target
 *	cell for APPENDING, then write the new contents to the END of
 *	the file.  If successful, rewind the now-expanded file and
 *	overwrite the beginning of the file, then truncate it.
 *
 *
 * Results:
 *	TRUE if the cell could be written successfully, FALSE otherwise.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Writes a file to disk.
 *	If successful, clears the CDMODIFIED, CDBOXESCHANGED,
 *	and CDSTAMPSCHANGED bits in cellDef->cd_flags.
 *
 *	In the event of an error while writing out the cell,
 *	the external integer errno is set to the UNIX error
 *	encountered, and the above bits are not cleared in
 *	cellDef->cd_flags.
