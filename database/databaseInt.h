/*
 * Contacts in Magic are funny beasts.  Instead of representing the via
 * holes separately from the two layers they connect, Magic bundles them
 * into a single "type" that implies the presence of adjacent vias.
 * In the discussion that follows, "contact" means the aggregate described
 * by a line in the "contacts" section of the technology file, while "type"
 * has its usual meaning, namely a TileType.  "Painting a contact" means
 * painting its primary type, namely the one that appeared in the "types"
 * section of the technology file (as opposed to any automatically generated
 * tile types).
 *
 * Magic represents contacts between tile planes by storing the tile type
 * on each plane, each of which is referred to as an "image" of the
 * particular type of contact on its respective plane.  The primary contact
 * type indicates the planes it connects to, and also the "residues" on
 * each connected plane (residues are the types that would be present if
 * there were no contact).
 *
 * When the technology file is read, the "types" section defines the tile
 * type names that users will paint and erase.  Contacts can be painted
 * and erased by a single name, but actually consist of several tiles;
 * the "contacts" section provides the information needed to automatically
 * generate the tiles needed to represent a contact with the specified
 * connectivity.
 *
 * Magic's scheme has a couple of important properties.  Each contact
 * defined in the technology file determines a set of planes that will
 * be painted with the type when that contact is painted over empty
 * space.
 *
 * The LayerInfo structure is used primarily to store information about
 * the various types of contacts, although it contains degenerate information
 * about non-contact types as well.
