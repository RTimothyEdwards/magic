/* This file mainly lifted from the main application routine for	*/
/* "wish" from the Tk distribution.					*/
/*									*/
/* This is a compact re-write of the "wish" executable that calls	*/
/* Tk_MainEx with application-specific processing.  Specifically, 	*/
/* "wish" doesn't allow the startup script (~/.wishrc) to be renamed.	*/
/* However, for magic running as an extension of Tcl, we want to source	*/
/* the magic.tcl file instead of ~/.wishrc.  So, all this file really	*/
/* does is to set the Tcl variable "tcl_rcFileName" to magic.tcl, so	*/
/* that it will be processed as the startup script, followed by a drop	*/
/* back to the Tcl interpreter command-line main loop.			*/
/*									*/
/* This is a standalone executable.  However, it is only called when	*/
/* "-noconsole" is specified on the UNIX command-line.  When the	*/
/* console is used, the console is capable of sourcing the magic.tcl	*/
/* script itself, and so it uses "wish" as the executable.  However,	*/
/* the console redirects standard input, so it prevents magic from	*/
/* being used in a batch processing mode.  Thus, to batch-process with	*/
/* magic, use "magic -noc -d NULL < script.tcl" or, interactively,	*/
/* "magic -noc -d NULL << EOF" followed by commands entered from stdin	*/
/* and ending with "EOF".						*/
/*									*/
/* The "magicexec" method replaces the former use of "wish" with the	*/
/* "magic" script setting HOME to point to the directory containing	*/
/* ".wishrc", a symbolic link to "magic.tcl".  That failed to work on	*/
/* remote systems because the $HOME environment variable is also used	*/
/* to find the user's .Xauthority file to authenticate the X11		*/
/* connection.								*/
