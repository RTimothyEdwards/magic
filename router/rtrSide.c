 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * rtrEnumSides --
 *
 * Enumerate each colinear boundary between a cell and empty space
 * in the cell 'def' that lies entirely within the area 'area'.
 * Colinear boundaries occur when, for example, two vertically
 * abutting cells share the same right-hand coordinate:
 *
 *		+-------+  ^
 *		|	|  |
 *		|   A	|  |
 *		|	|  |
 *	   +----+-------+  | colinear boundary
 *	   |		|  |
 *	   |	  B	|  |
 *	   |		|  |
 *	   +------------+  v
 *
 * The parameter minChannelWidth is a threshold on how much space
 * must exist between a cell and its neighbors in order for us
 * to enumerate a Side facing in a particular direction.  It is
 * interpreted as follows:
 *
 *	--------+	|			       |	+-------
 *		|	|			       |	|
 *	  cell1	|	A <----- minChannelWidth ----> B	| cell2
 *		|	|			       |	|
 *	--------+	|			       |	+-------
 *
 * The line 'A' is the closest legal grid line to cell1, as is 'B'
 * the closest legal grid line to cell2 (the nearest neighbor to cell1
 * along its RHS).  If these are not at least minChannelWidth apart,
 * don't enumerate the RHS of cell1.
 *
 * Applies the supplied function to each boundary found.  This
 * function should be of the following form:
 *
 *	int
 *	(*func)(side, cdata)
 *	    Side *side;
 *	    ClientData cdata;
 *	{
 *	}
 *
 * The Side it is passed has side_trans set to the transform from the
 * canonical orientation (where side appears to be on the RHS of a group
 * of cells) to the original orientation.  Side_line is set to a zero-
 * width rectangle along the boundary being processed, in transformed
 * coordinates.  Also in transformed coordinates are side_search, set
 * to a 1-unit wide rectangle along the boundary but extending in the
 * direction of the cells' interiors, and side_used extending in the
 * opposite direction from side_search to the nearest usable grid
 * point.  Side_next is set to NULL.
 *
 * The function should return 0 if we should continue enumerating
 * Sides, or 1 if we should abort.
 *
 * Results:
 *	Returns 0 if we completed successfully, or 1 if (*func)()
 *	returned 1 or we were interrupted (SigInterruptPending != 0).
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Whatever is done by the client procedure.
 *	We use the ti_client fields of the tiles in the cell tile
 *	plane for markings, and reset them to their uninitialized
 *	value when done (CLIENTDEFAULT).
