 *
 * plowSliverTopExtent --
 * plowSliverBotExtent --
 *
 * Called by plowSrOutline() to follow the upper/lower penumbra's
 * outline(s), and see how much of that outline must be moved to
 * avoid introducing slivers.
 *
 * Results:
 *	Returns 1 to stop plowSrOutline from following the outline
 *	any more, or 0 to continue.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Modifies the following fields of the applyRule struct pointed
 *	to by 'ar':
 *
 *		ar_lastx	-- continuously updated to the rightmost
 *				   final X coordinate of any vertical
 *				   edge.  When a vertical edge is seen
 *				   with a final X coordinate less than
 *				   ar_lastx, we know we're done.
 *		ar_mustmove	-- new X to which each sliver must be moved.
 *		ar_slivtype	-- material forming the sliver itself.
