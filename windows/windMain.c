/* windMain.c -
 *
 *	This package implements overlapping windows for the
 *	Magic VLSI layout system.
 *
 * Design:
 *	Windows are structures that are kept in a doubly linked list.
 *	Windows near the front of the list are on top of windows further
 *	towards the tail of the list.  Each window has some information
 *	about what is in the window, as well as the size of the window
 *	(both unclipped and clipped to accommodate windows that overlay it).
 *	Transforms control what portion of the window's contents show up
 *	on the screen, and at what magnification.
 *
 *	Each window is owned by a client (the database, a menu package, etc.).
 *	The window package is notified of a new client by the AddClient
 *	call.  The client supplies routines to redisplay the contents of
 *	a window, and to do other things with the window (such as delete it).
 *	Each window is a view onto a surface maintained by the client.  The
 *	client may be asked to redisplay any part of this surface at any time.
 *	The client must also supply each window with an ID that uniquely
 *	identifies the surface.
 *
 *	There are currently two types of window packages supported:  Magic
 *	windows (implemented here) and Sun Windows.  In Magic windows, all
 * 	windows use the screen's coordinate system.  In Sun Windows, each
 *	window has it's own coordinate system with (0, 0) being at the lower
 *	left corner.  Also, under Sun Windows some of the screen managment
 *	stuff (such as clipping to obscuring areas and drawing of the
 *	screen background color) is ignored by us.
