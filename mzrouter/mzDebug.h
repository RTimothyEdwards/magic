 * mzDebug.h --
 *
 * Declarations of debugging flag "handles" for maze router.
 *
 * This include file is referenced inside mzInternal.h, hence hiding this
 * file from make.  This is so that debuging flags can be added without
 * forcing recompilation of everything.
 *
 * Debug flags are defined and registered with the debug module in mzInit.c
 * NOTE: the values of the externs defined below are NOT THE FLAG VALUES,
 * rather they are handles for the flags - flags are tested with calls to
 * DebugIsSet().
