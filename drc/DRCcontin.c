 * drcCheckTile --
 *
 *	This procedure is called when a check tile is found in
 *	the DRC_CHECK plane of the CellDef at the front of the
 *	DRCPending list.  This procedure is the heart of Magic's
 *	continuous checker.
 *
 *	For DRC purposes, each cell is divided up checkerboard-style
 *	into areas DRCStepSize on each side.  All checking is done
 *	in terms of these squares.  When a check tile is found, we
 *	find the outer area of all check tiles in the square containing
 *	the original check tile's lower-left corner.  Errors within
 *	this area are regenerated, then all check tiles in that area
 *	are erased.  The checkerboard approach serves three purposes.
 *	First, it allows nearby small tiles to be combined for checking
 *	purposes.  Second, it limits the maximum amount of work that
 *	is done at once, so if we're getting interrupted by new commands
 *	there is still some hope of eventually getting the DRC caught up.
 *	And third, it provides a canonical form for the checks, particularly
 *	those involving subcells, so the same results are produced no
 *	matter what the original check area is.
 *
 *	The three DRC meta-rules are:
 *		(1) paint in one CellDef must be consistent by itself,
 *			that is, without regard to subcells
 *		(2) subtrees must be consistent -- this includes both
 *			paint interacting with subcells, and subcells
 *			interacting with each other.
 *		(3) an arrayed use of a CellDef must be consistent by itself,
 *			that is, without regard to paint or other subcells
 *			in the parent.  This check happens automatically as
 *			part of the subtree check.
 *
 *	Two types of error tiles are kept independently in the
 *	DRC_ERROR plane:	(1) paint
 *				(2) subtree
 *
 *	This function is passed to DBSrPaintArea().
 *
 * Results:
 *	Always returns one.  This function is only called on non-space
 *	(CHECK) tiles, so if it is called a CHECK tile must have been
 *	processed and we want DBSrPaintArea to abort the search.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Modifies both DRC planes of the CellDef at the front of the
