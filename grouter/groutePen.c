 * glPenCompute --
 *
 * Some routing regions will have many nets passing through them.
 * It may be, however, that some of these nets need a given region
 * much more than others: the cost to them of going around the
 * region is very high.  This procedure attempts to identify
 * congested regions (CZones), and furthermore to determine the
 * nets that should be penalized for using those regions and the
 * amount of the penalty.
 *
 * On input, the gc_prevDens and gc_postDens fields of each channel's
 * associated GlobChan structure should be set up to reflect the
 * presence of blocking information.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *	Route each net as though it were the first net to be routed.
 *	Avoid routing through any portion of a channel that is already
 *	at density (from pre-existing wiring), but otherwise don't
 *	bother computing penalties.  Choose crossing points to give
 *	locally (i.e, per-channel) optimal lengths.  This enables
 *	us to avoid looking at most crossing points so we can route
 *	very quickly.
 *
 *	Remember each of the paths that comprised each net by storing
 *	a permanent copy of each in the list nc_paths in the NetClient
 *	structure for each net.
 *
 *	After all nets have been processed, update density in the
 *	gc_postDens density map of all channels to reflect the routes
 *	assigned to all nets.  For each region of a channel where density
 *	has been exceeded, we look at all the nets that pass through the
 *	region and see how expensive it would be to route each one if it
 *	had to avoid that region entirely.  (It is infinitely expensive
 *	if the region contains either the starting or ending point of the
 *	route!)
 *
 *	While the costs computed above are just an estimate (since they
 *	consider each net independently), the hope is that they will
 *	identify fairly well those nets that can easily avoid congested
 *	areas with only slight detours, as well as those nets for which
 *	certain regions of channels are critical.
 *
 *	We pick those nets whose cost increases the least by having to
 *	avoid the congested region as those that will be penalized; the
 *	penalty for each net is the additional cost of avoiding the region
 *	for the net for which this cost is highest.  (In effect, this gives
 *	us a balanced tradeoff: the net with low cost for not using the
 *	channel won't use it unless it has otherwise to make at least as
 *	big a detour as our estimate for the most expensive one).
 *
 * Results:
 *	None.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Stores a pointer to a list of CZone structures in
 *	the nnet_cdata->nc_pens field of each net in netList.
 *	(The list may be NULL).  Each element in the list identifies
 *	a channel and a penalty; the interpretation is that this
 *	net should be penalized by the indicated penalty if it
 *	has to go through this channel.
 *	Also uses nnet_cdata->nc_paths as temporary working storage.
