 * Route a multi-terminal net.
 * Currently includes just a single algorithm, for routing a net
 * where arbitrary branching is allowed.  This algorithm produces
 * something like a steiner-tree, with intermediate points introduced

 * glMultiSteiner --
 *
 * Perform global routing for all segments of a net.
 * The caller supplies two procedures: one to produce a list of
 * GlPoints from any of a set of possible starting points to the
 * single destination, and the other to accept a list of GlPoints
 * and remember it permanently, e.g, in the form of crossing assignments.
 *
 * The two procedures are of the following form:
 *
 *	GlPoint *
 *	(*routeProc)(startList, loc, bestCost, cdRoute)
 *	    GlPoint *startList;	--- list of GlPoints that are possible
 *				--- starting points for the route; the
 *				--- points in the list are linked via gl_path
 *				--- fields as though they were a path.
 *	    NLTermLoc *loc;	--- loc->nloc_pin is the destination
 *	    int bestCost;	--- return NULL if we can't beat this cost
 *	    ClientData cdRoute;	--- same as cdRoute passed to us
 *	{
 *	}
 *
 *	int
 *	(*markProc)(rootUse, path, pNetId, cdMark)
 *	    CellUse *rootUse;	--- leave feedback here if necessary and if
 *				--- rootUse is non-NULL
 *	    GlPoint *path;	--- path to be marked
 *	    NetId *pNetId;	--- netid_net is the argument 'net' to
 *				--- glMultiSteiner; netid_seg will be
 *				--- incremented for each new segment id
 *				--- assigned.
 *	    ClientData cdMark;	--- same as 'cdMark' passed to us
 *	{
 *	}
 *
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *	The net has at least two terminals, each of which has at least
 *	one valid location.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *	Multiterminal nets are routed using an algorithm that finds
 *	pseudo-Steiner tree routes.  The idea is to process the
 *	terminals of the net in the order they appear in the netlist.
 *	Processing consists of finding the shortest path from the
 *	terminal being considered to all of the terminals processed
 *	before it, or to any of the crossing points used by the routes
 *	used to connect these previously-processed terminals.
 *
 * Results:
 *	Returns the number of terminals processed.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Whatever (*routeProc)() and (*markProc)() do.
