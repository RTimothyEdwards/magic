/*
 * grouteMain.c --
 *
 * Top level code for the global signal router.
 *
 * The global router's job is to find the sequence of channel pins
 * through which each signal must pass, and mark these pins so the
 * channel router can connect them within each channel.
 *
 * Our overall approach is greedy: we compute the area of the bounding
 * box of all terminals in a net for each net, and perform global routing
 * of each net in order of increasing area of this bounding box.  This
 * has the effect of routing more constrained nets first, and less
 * constrained ones later.
